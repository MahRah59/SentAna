delivery was good and the customer support works decently. People working in the shop could act more customer friendly.
Installation of equipment performed as planned, however many errors have happened. 
The software version has to be upgraded to include more sophisticated features.
Troubleshooting has to be improved. Last week the response for hot TRâ€™s was slow.
Engineers who are responsible for maintenance are not satisfied with existing SLA. It has to be changed to make quick problem solving. 
The product portfolio looks good, excited to see a presentation of the portfolio.
My order is delayed and it makes me disappointed.
I am happy that I received what I ordered in time.
The presentation was okay, as expected.
The shipment is done as planned.
The implementation project is delayed, which puts us in a weak position compared to our competitors. 
Can you please inform me about this as soon as possible?
We had a face to face meeting which was better than Face-time meeting but it has to happen more often.
