3. Volvo shines in European EV market as Tesla deliveries drop

Content:
The European electric vehicle (EV) market had mixed results in the first quarter. Volvo models excelled, while Tesla deliveries dropped. José Pontes, data director at EV Volumes (part of J.D. Power), explores the figures with Autovista24 journalist Tom Hooker. A total of 295,980 EVs were registered in Europe during March, down 8% year on year. March’s figures were heavily impacted by a drop in Tesla deliveries, declining 35% compared to the same period in 2023. Plug-ins models accounted for 21% of all new-car registrations in the month. Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) alone accounted for 14% of the market with 196,068 units. Looking at the first quarter of 2024, EVs achieved the same growth as the overall market, up 5% with 701,805 deliveries. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) registrations climbed 10% across the first three months of the year, with 252,019 registrations. BEVs saw slower growth of just 3%, although this was a larger volume of 449,786 deliveries. EVs recorded a 21% market share in the first quarter, as BEVs sat at 13%, dropping slightly compared to March’s total. Across the first three months of the year, BEVs held a 64% share of the plug-in market. This was a slump against the 66% share recorded at the same point last year. The removal of incentives is still affecting BEV registrations in regions such as Germany. Furthermore, new mass-market EVs including the Renault 5 and Citroen e-C3 are still not on the road. This means significant growth for the technology is not expected until the second half of 2024. Hybrids, including full and mild hybrids, were the fastest-growing powertrain in Europe in the first quarter, with deliveries surging 20% and accounting for 30% of the overall market. Growth from BEVs, PHEVs and hybrids has come at the expense of diesel, which saw volumes fall 11% across the first quarter. Its current 11% market share is a stark contrast from its 50% hold in 2015. Despite a drop in deliveries, Tesla once again topped Europe’s EV best-selling models chart. The Model Y took first in March, with 26,790 registrations. However, the midsize crossover’s volume shrunk by 19% compared to the same period in 2023. Last year in March, the BEV was the best-selling model in Europe’s overall new-car market, yet in 2024 it has fallen to fourth. The Model Y saw its highest demand in the UK with 5,590 deliveries, followed by Germany (3,244 units) France (3,045 units), the Netherlands (2,386 units) and Sweden (2,011 units). Furthermore, Norway (1,993 units), Belgium (1,717 units) and Switzerland (1,507 units) also posted four-digit figures. One factor impacting the crossover is its sibling, the Tesla Model 3. Despite the market leader more than doubling the volume of the sedan in March, it has begun to cannibalise sales of the Model Y in some regions. The Model 3 secured second in March with 12,011 deliveries, up 36% in the first quarter of the year. Its best-selling market was in the Netherlands (1,510 units), as France (1,388 units), the UK (1,375 units) and Belgium (1,362 units) also enjoyed positive performances. Third place went to the Volvo EX30, achieving 7,642 registrations in its third month on the market. Strong results are expected in the coming months, with deliveries possibly reaching five-digit figures. The SUV is currently the brand's cheapest model, starting at €39,000. It is also Volvo’s smallest offering, sitting at the same size as a Volkswagen (VW) ID.3. The model was popular in the UK (1,510 units), followed by France (1,395 units) and the Netherlands (1,173 units). In fourth place, the Audi Q4 e-Tron had a positive month, with 6,548 deliveries. Unlike its siblings using the MEB platform, the crossover is continuing to see demand. However, it could be pressured in the future by the upcoming Q6 e-Tron. The compact model also sold well in the UK (2,113 units), followed at a distance by Germany (1,115 units) and Belgium (570 units). Thanks to a record performance, the Volvo XC60 PHEV finished in fifth, reaching 5,752 registrations. Despite the SUV’s current generation dating back to 2017, it managed four-digit results in Germany (1,324 units). It performed well in its domestic market of Sweden (1,010 units) while the UK also boosted numbers (701 units). This result holds promise for the future Volvo EX60. The Volvo XC40 recorded its best performance in 10 months with 5,595 deliveries. This meant three models from the Swedish manufacturer made the top six. The SUV is seemingly unaffected by the demand for its new sibling, the EX30. Further down the chart, the VW ID.4 returned to the table in 11th place, posting 4,680 registrations. Other positivity in the VW Group came from the Audi A3 PHEV, achieving a record 4,275 deliveries to take 16th place. Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz saw success with its GLC PHEV, finishing in 18th thanks to 4,051 registrations. This was the SUV's best result since December 2021, and a record figure for the model’s current generation. These two PHEVs are

Let CFO Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The company’s deputy CFO Fredrik Hansson will step into its top financial seat just a month after Håkan Samuelsson rejoined Volvo as its CEO. Hansson joined the Gothenburg, Sweden-based automaker in 2021, and was appointed to the role of deputy CFO and to the company’s Group Management Team in 2023, according to the Thursday press release. Prior to Volvo, he served as a partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Company, according to his LinkedIn profile. The company’s executive leadership shifts come as Volvo, like other automakers, is weathering ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, such as continuing uncertainty regarding potential tariffs that are set to be levied on the automotive space. In March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles — which took effect at the top of April —  as well as a 25% tariff on imports of auto parts, the latter of which is set to go into effect next month. Volvo recently announced it would be laying off between 550 to 800 employees at various sites across the U.S., in the face of continued market turmoil that is likely to lead to slumping demand for its vehicles, according to a report by CNBC. The automaker reported a 10% drop in global sales for the month of March compared to the prior year period, according to a sales update published on April 2. Sales in the U.S. declined by 8% year-over-year to 14,052 cars, though sales of Volvo’s electrified models rose by 5% compared to the prior year period, the company said. Other automakers have also reported dips in sales amid rapid shifts in tariff and trade policy by the Trump administration. On Tuesday, electric vehicle maker Tesla reported lukewarm results for its most recent quarter, including dropping profit, that followed slumping sales, with CFO Vaibhav Taneja noting expected tariffs on the auto space will have an impact on the company’s profitability. Automotive industry groups, meanwhile, have expressed concern on the imposition of tariffs on automotive parts, set to go into effect on May 3. In an April 21 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, various automotive trade groups warned the 25% tariff on auto parts will “will scramble the global automotive supply chain and set off a domino effect that will lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive and less predictable. Most auto suppliers are not capitalized for an abrupt tariff induced disruption,” the letter, signed by various associations including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, American Automotive Policy Council and American International Automobile Dealers Association, reads. “Many are already in distress and will face production stoppages, layoffs and bankruptcy.”
The Trump administration is reportedly considering reducing certain tariffs on the auto industry, including potentially exempting auto parts in compliance with the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. Volvo is set to reports its Q1 2025 earnings on April 29. The company declined to comment beyond the press release. Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts

The production changes affect Volvo’s only American plant. Volvo Cars said it will cut approximately 125 jobs, or 5% of the workforce, at its Charleston, South Carolina factory as the company adjusts to shifting market conditions and evolving trade policies. The company made the announcement on Wednesday as part of a broader effort to realign operations and sharpen its U.S. strategy. The production changes affect Volvo’s only American plant, which currently employs about 2,500 workers and builds the EX90 electric SUV and the Polestar’s model 3. Despite having a capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles annually, the facility has seen relatively low output, with only 1,316 EX90s sold in the U.S. so far in 2024. Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox. Volvo, which is majority-owned by China’s Geely Holding, emphasized its long-term commitment to U.S. manufacturing. The automaker said it remains on track to create 4,000 jobs in South Carolina and plans to expand output at the Charleston site in the future. The company clarified that it is implementing recent job cuts separate from the broader global cost-saving measures announced last week in its Q1 earnings report, which includes a plan to reduce expenses by 18 billion Swedish crowns (approximately $1.88 billion). However, the automaker has not specified when it will share more details about the job cuts or which specific roles will be affected. With nearly 43,000 employees worldwide—29,000 in Europe, 10,000 in Asia, and 3,000 in the Americas—Volvo says the U.S. remains a core market. The company reiterated that its focus remains on strengthening its American product lineup and manufacturing footprint. Read More

6. Volvo Prepares for a Wild Truck-Market Ride - Equipment - Trucking ...

The new Volvo VNL will enter into full production this Fall -- just as the 2027 prebuy is starting to pick up steam. It’s been a busy year for Volvo Trucks North America. Globally, the Swedish OEM has carved out a leading position in the drive to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation emissions. Here at home, that effort has been spearheaded by the launch of the all-new VNL Class 8 tractor. From its very inception, the new VNL was designed by Volvo’s global engineering team to take full advantage of every new technology available today — as well as a few technologies that haven’t been perfected yet. The result is Volvo’s greenest, most aerodynamic truck ever. It’s also the most connected truck the OEM has ever created. And it’s a truck that sets new standards for driver comfort, ergonomics and productivity as well. In mid-June, Volvo invited transportation journalists to its New River Valley truck manufacturing plant in Dublin, Virginia. The intent was to give an update on the state of the industry on the cusp of what appear to be some very turbulent months to come. Volvo also wanted to provide journalists with a more in-depth overview of the new VNL tractor. Magnus Koeck, vice president, strategy, brand and marketing for Volvo Trucks North America, opened his remarks to journalists by noting that the VNL sneak-peek video earlier in the year garnered more than 25 million views on YouTube. And more than 7,000 people watched the actual truck launch live on the Internet. “I dare to say that Volvo has set a new standard when it comes to digital truck launches,” Koeck noted with satisfaction. Year-to-date, Koeck went on to say, Volvo’s market share is 0.7% higher than at the same time last year. Obviously, the OEM is looking for more robust growth, he added. And Volvo expects market share numbers to climb considerably when new VNL deliveries actually begin in the fourth quarter — in October, most likely. Magnus Koeck, vice president, strategy, brand and marketing for Volvo Trucks North America, said he believes the "massive" 2027 truck prebuy has already begun. Volvo enjoys 43% market share in the North American electric truck market, Koeck added. So far, the OEM has delivered 470 VNR Electric models to 57 unique customers across North America. “The overall electric truck market in North America is 1,400 units,” Koeck added. “So, it’s still a very small market. But we know that it will grow. And we will in invest heavily in this technology for the future.”
That said, Koeck acknowledged that it may take longer for that market to develop than originally thought. To date, Volvo has 62 certified electric truck dealerships in North America. Another 40 dealerships are currently in the process of obtaining that certification. “You cannot order a Volvo electric truck unless you are located near a Volvo electric-certified dealership,” he added. Taking a wider view of Volvo’s ongoing initiatives, Koeck noted that the OEM invested more than $400 million in the new VNL — including an all-new cab for the truck. He also stressed the urgent need for localized electric vehicle battery production in the U.S.
Volvo is responding to that need with the purchase of battery manufacturer Proterra, Koeck added. Those assets include a battery manufacturing plant in South Carolina and assembly facilities in California. Koeck said Volvo will resume production at those locations soon and complement them with additional capabilities in the future. Volvo will also have an all-new, state-of-the-art truck manufacturing plant up and running in Mexico. The company is investing in this new plant to meet anticipated capacity demands in the Class 8 market heading into 2027. In January of 2027, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Phase 3 Greenhouse Gas regulations will become law. And Koeck — along with many other trucking experts — is anticipating a significant Class 8 “prebuy” ahead of that deadline. But right now, according to Koeck, the North American truck market is in a “correction” phase. “The second quarter of this year was the worst we’ve seen in a decade,” Koeck said. “But the market is now behaving exactly as we anticipated. “Overall, the industry recovered quickly from economic issues related to the COVID pandemic. That pace has slowed somewhat. However, private fleets are doing pretty well. And we are seeing signs that the 2027 prebuy has already begun and is slowly gaining steam.”
A 1996 Volvo VNL rests in a place of honor in the Volvo Customer Center in Dublin, Virginia. All told, Koeck said, Volvo analysts are convinced that the North American truck market will rebound strongly by the end of this year — even if the economy softens somewhat. Simple math supports that prediction. “In 2027, a new Class 8 truck will cost $20,000 more than a comparable model does today,” Koeck said. “That’s why we believe there will be a massive truck prebuy in 2026. Again, we see signs it has already begun. We look for it to gain momentum

Developing a self-driving truck with Volvo that’s both reliable and scalable
Volvo, the second-largest heavy-duty truck manufacturer in the world, builds hundreds of thousands of trucks each year and has developed trusted relationships with shippers and carriers over the course of decades. By joining forces with Volvo Autonomous Solutions, Aurora has the support of Volvo’s trucking industry stature, engineering prowess, production capacity, commercial relationships, and safety leadership to commercialize Aurora-powered Volvo trucks at scale. Aurora is leveraging the power of the Aurora Driver Development Program to structure the engagement with Volvo and maximize the combined team’s strengths in world-class vehicle engineering, manufacturing and support, and autonomous vehicle technology development. Moving safely and efficiently with Volvo
Safely developing vehicles powered by the Aurora Driver for wide deployment is an extremely rigorous multi-phase process. This incredibly complex process is why Aurora is collaborating with Volvo to design the VNL architecture for its Driver and why these trucks will be manufactured on Volvo’s own production line. Volvo has led the industry in safety for nearly 100 years, and validates all vehicles against its own industry leading safety standards. Additionally, to ensure the safety of what Aurora and Volvo are building together, Aurora is rigorously adhering to the guidelines in its Safety Case Framework, which must be satisfied before the safety driver can be removed. Over the next several months, Aurora will integrate its feature-complete hardware kit and test and validate Aurora-powered Volvo VNL trucks through its robust Virtual Testing Suite. Founded in 2017 by experts in the self-driving industry, Aurora is on a mission to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly. To move both people and goods, the company is building the Aurora Driver, a platform that brings together software, hardware and data services to autonomously operate passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, and heavy-duty trucks. Aurora is backed by Sequoia Capital, Baillie Gifford, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, among others, and is partnered with industry leaders including Toyota, Uber, Volvo, and PACCAR. Aurora tests its vehicles in the Bay Area, Pittsburgh, and Dallas. The company has offices in those areas as well as in Bozeman, MT; Seattle, WA; Louisville, CO; and Wixom, MI. To learn more, visit www.aurora.tech.

﻿Is the market ready for a four-wheeled digital detox? Ask just about anybody, and they’ll tell you that new cars are too expensive. In the wake of tariffs shaking the auto industry and with the Trump administration pledging to kill the federal EV incentive, that situation isn’t looking to get better soon, especially for anyone wanting something battery-powered. Changing that overly spendy status quo is going to take something radical, and it’s hard to get more radical than what Slate Auto has planned. Meet the Slate Truck, a sub-$20,000 (after federal incentives) electric vehicle that enters production next year. It only seats two yet has a bed big enough to hold a sheet of plywood. It only does 150 miles on a charge, only comes in gray, and the only way to listen to music while driving is if you bring along your phone and a Bluetooth speaker. It is the bare minimum of what a modern car can be, and yet it’s taken three years of development to get to this point. But this is more than bargain-basement motoring. Slate is presenting its truck as minimalist design with DIY purpose, an attempt to not just go cheap but to create a new category of vehicle with a huge focus on personalization. That design also enables a low-cost approach to manufacturing that has caught the eye of major investors, reportedly including Jeff Bezos. It’s been engineered and will be manufactured in America, but is this extreme simplification too much for American consumers? If you haven’t seen the leaks and the reports of weirdly wrapped trucks hiding in plain sight, the Slate Truck is the first product from Michigan-based Slate Auto. Think “American kei truck” and you’re not far off. It’s a machine designed to be extremely basic, extremely customizable, and extremely affordable. Those are not your typical design goals, but then the Slate Truck isn’t the fruit of your typical design process. Wander through any automotive design studio anywhere in the world and you’ll inevitably come across a mood board or two, sweeping collages of striking photos meant to align the creative flows of passers-by. They’re a tool for helping a disparate design team to create a cohesive product, but where many such mood boards feature glamour shots of exotic roads and beautiful people, front and center in the Slate’s mood board was something different: a big, gray shark, covered in scrapes and scars. “It looks like a shark that has definitely been in more than one brawl and clearly has come out ahead because it’s still swimming,” says Tisha Johnson, head of design at Slate and who formerly spent a decade at Volvo. That aesthetic, of highlighting rather than hiding battle scars, is key to the Slate ethos. Instead of steel or aluminum, the Slate Truck’s body panels are molded of plastic. Or, as Slate calls them, “injection molded polypropylene composite material.” The theory is that this makes them more durable and scratch-resistant, if only because the lack of paint means they’re one color all the way through. Auto enthusiasts of a certain age will remember the same approach used by the now-defunct Saturn Corporation, a manufacturing technique that never caught on across the industry. Slate continues the theme through to the upholstery, too, a heathered textile that was designed to get better looking as it wears. The idea is to lean into the aged aesthetic. But not everybody will dig the shark theme, and so the Slate Truck is designed to be customizable to a degree never seen before on a production vehicle. Johnson says this is in contrast to the overly curated experience offered by many brands. She says over-curation by automotive designers results in situations like premium, luxury cars that are only available in a palette of disappointingly bland colors: “There’s usually only a fraction that you actually want, and those are always more expensive,” she says. Disparaging other brands for offering limited color choices might seem disingenuous coming from the designer of a vehicle available in a single shade. The Slate Truck, though, was designed to take advantage of the current trend of vinyl-wrapping cars. Its simple shape and minimal trim pieces mean that even amateurs can do the job. Slate will offer DIY kits that newbies can slap on in an afternoon and replace just as quickly based on mood. However, the biggest benefit of this monochromatic thinking might come in production. It’s probably no surprise to you that building cars is expensive. Elon Musk loves to bemoan just how complicated the process can be whenever Tesla is late shipping its next new model, but he’s far from alone in that assessment. What is a little less commonly known is just how expensive it is to paint those cars. Creating a facility that can reliably, quickly, and cleanly lay down a quality coat of color on automotive body parts is a complicated task. That task has only gotten more complicated (and thus expensive) in recent years, with greater environmental regulations and c

11. Automakers suspend financial guidance amid tariff uncertainty

Content:
Several global automakers, including Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, have joined Michigan-based General Motors and Volvo in suspending their respective annual financial guidance reports for investors amid growing tariff uncertainty. The announcements on Wednesday came even as US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to soften the blow of the auto tariffs that he had imposed earlier this month. “While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,” Stellantis board chairman John Elkann said in a statement. Stellantis said it was “suspending its 2025 financial guidance … due to evolving tariff policies, as well as the difficulty predicting possible impacts on market volumes and the competitive landscape.”
This comes amid layoffs at Stellantis, a carmaker that houses 14 brands including Jeep, RAM Trucks, Dodge, Fiat, and Maserati. In April, it temporarily laid off 900 workers for two weeks and said at the time it was because of uncertainty about how Trump-imposed tariffs would affect its business. Antonio Filosa, Stellantis’s chief operating officer for the Americas, said in a company-wide email that it would assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on its operations, but also have “decided to take some immediate actions”. The company reported a 14-percent drop in its first-quarter sales to $40.7bn (35.8bn euros) in its first-quarter earnings report released on Wednesday. Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmakers, reported big drops in their net profits over the same January-March period, before the US tariffs kicked in. Mercedes cited “volatility with regard to tariff policies” that meant business development could not be reliably forecast. Mercedes’s net profit plunged almost 43 percent in the first three months of the year to $1.9 bn (1.73 billion euros)
Finance chief Harald Wilhelm said Mercedes still remains in a strong position, thanks to what he said was a strong position in profitable, top-end vehicles. “This, combined with a healthy balance sheet, provides a solid foundation to navigate our company through a period of geopolitical uncertainties,” he said. About 40 companies worldwide, across industries, have pulled or lowered their forward guidance in the first two weeks of the first-quarter earnings season, an analysis by the news agency Reuters showed. On Tuesday, social media giant Snap declined to offer future guidance, saying it was seeing a slowdown in ad spending and raised doubts about advertising budgets due to tariff impact, sending its stock down 15 percent on Wednesday. Before the tariffs, European automakers were already facing slowing sales of electric cars and stiff competition from local rivals, as well as from Chinese EVs, for which it is a key market. Volkswagen, a 10-brand group that includes Audi, Skoda and Porsche, said its net profit fell 40.6 percent to $2.49bn (2.19 bn euros). For the rest of the year, the carmaker said that it expected business “towards the lower end” of its guidance, citing challenges including increased competition, more stringent emissions regulations and trade tensions. Speaking on a call for analysts and investors, Volkswagen’s finance chief Arno Antlitz said that it was “too early to say” if Volkswagen would step up manufacturing in the US to circumvent any tariffs. Volkswagen expects a profit margin of 5.5 to 6.5 percent for the coming year, but its guidance does not take into account changeable American tariffs. “It’s highly difficult to give a projection for the full year,” Antlitz said. UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a client note that the German group’s outlook did not “include any impact of US tariffs,” calling it “essentially a withdrawal of guidance”. In the United Kingdom, luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda announced that it was limiting shipments to the US, but it maintained its annual guidance as it reported a 13-percent drop in first-quarter revenue. Besides a 25-percent tariff on finished imported cars, the industry has also been affected by Trump’s 25-percent tariff on steel and aluminium. Carmakers are also set to face new tariffs on foreign auto parts expected to take effect on May 3. Trump’s new policy means that a company would not face both a 25-percent levy for an imported vehicle and 25-percent on steel or aluminium. The importer would pay the higher of the two levies, but not both, a US Commerce Department official said. The other change is that companies that import parts for vehicles assembled in the US would be able to offset 3.75 percent of a vehicle’s list price in the first year and 2.5 percent in the second year. But analysts believe that this reprieve won’t necessarily work in practice as automakers face the effect tariffs will have on their business. “While this sounds goo

The Volvo Group plans to let go as many as 800 workers at three US facilities over the next three months due to market uncertainty and demand concerns in the face of Donald Trump’s tariffs, reports Reuters. Volvo Group North America, which has an almost-20,000-strong workforce, said in a statement that it has told its employees of plans to lay off 550-800 people at its Mack Trucks site in Macungie, Pennsylvania and two Volvo Group facilities in Dublin, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland. “Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs. We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles,” a spokesperson told Reuters via email.

This 1973 Volvo 1800ES is one of a reported 5,000 examples produced for the model year, and it was acquired by the current owner in 2020 following a reported period of long-term storage in a collection. Subsequent service included repairing the speedometer and replacing the exhaust manifold, fuel pump, brake master cylinder, and various trim pieces. The car is finished in Sun Yellow over black leather, and power is provided by a 2.0-liter inline-four paired with a three-speed automatic transmission. It is equipped with 15″ pressed steel wheels, a glass rear hatch, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes, a push-button AM/FM radio, and air conditioning. This 1800ES is now offered on dealer consignment at no reserve with service records and a clean South Dakota title. Introduced in 1972 as the last variant of the P1800, the 1800ES featured a shooting brake design with a glass rear hatch. This example left the factory finished in Sun Yellow (107) and is equipped with twin exhaust outlets, dual side mirrors, chrome bumpers, and side trim, the latter of which was replaced in December 2020. The selling dealer reports the front valance was repainted under previous ownership. Inoperative windshield wipers and areas of touch-up paint are noted along with rust on the left quarter panel. The 15″ pressed steel wheels wear trim rings and are mounted with Vredestein Sprint ST 70 tires. The car rides on an independent front suspension with a live-axle setup with a Panhard bar out back. Braking is handled by power-assisted four-wheel discs. The brake master cylinder was replaced in October 2023. The reclining front bucket seats and folding rear bench are trimmed in black leather, and woven mats line the front footwells. Interior appointments include a front-passenger grab handle, a locking console storage compartment, a push-button AM/FM Blaupunkt radio, and air conditioning.

15. Volvo Cars Starts Production of Best-Selling EX30 Electric SUV in Europe

Last Updated on: 29th April 2025, 09:23 am
Volvo Cars and its Ghent manufacturing plant reached a crucial milestone this week as the company’s factory in Belgium started production of the fully electric EX30 small SUV. One of Europe’s best-selling electric cars in 2024, the EX30 has been a popular choice among customers from the moment it was introduced in late 2023. This week’s milestone follows a previously announced intent to produce the EX30 in the Ghent plant, which will also start production of the EX30 Cross Country later in the year. Volvo Cars continues to further diversify its global manufacturing footprint for one of its most popular models and expands production capacity to better meet local demand. The addition of the EX30 to the Ghent production line will result in around 350 new jobs at the plant, bringing total employment to almost 6,600 people. “The EX30 is crucial for us as we continue to strengthen our position in the premium EV market in Europe,” said Francesca Gamboni, chief manufacturing and supply chain officer for Volvo Cars. “Investing in the European production of the EX30 in Ghent perfectly aligns with our long-held strategy to build our cars where they sell best. Our flexible global footprint contributes to our resilience, allowing us to adjust our manufacturing plans with agility.”
To make EX30 production possible in Ghent, the company made investments worth around EUR 200 million in its Belgian facility in recent years. Wide-ranging changes to the plant include the addition of a completely new car platform, the installation of almost 600 new or refurbished robots, an extension of the battery hall, a new door production line as well as a new battery pack assembly line. EX30 production in Europe supports the European Union’s sustainability and competitiveness agenda, representing an investment in a  future that creates jobs and embraces innovation and electrification. Between the Ghent, Belgium and Torslanda, Sweden plants, Volvo Cars now produces 10 different electric and hybrid car models in Europe. “Following a decision in autumn 2023 to bring production of the EX30 to Ghent, we were able to industrialise the new model in record time,” said Stefan Fesser, manager of the Volvo Car plant in Ghent. “Thanks to the engagement and collaboration of the entire Ghent team, we cut the industrialisation time in half. Today, we are extremely proud to welcome the EX30 and demonstrate that new technology and innovation enable us to react more flexibly to market demands.”
Located on the outskirts of Belgium’s third-largest city and in the heart of its North Sea port area, Volvo Cars’ factory in Ghent opened its doors in 1965 and is the only remaining fully developed car factory in Belgium. Together with the Torslanda plant, it is one of two car manufacturing plants operated by Volvo Cars in Europe, with a third under construction in Slovakia. Apart from the EX30, the Ghent plant also builds other electrified models – the fully electric EX40 and EC40 as well as the XC40 and V60 hybrid models. In 2024, it built a little over 186,000 cars. Press release from Volvo Cars. For the full year 2024, Volvo Car Group recorded a record-breaking core operating profit of SEK 27 billion. Revenue in 2024 amounted to an all-time high of SEK 400.2 billion, while global sales reached a record 763,389 cars. Volvo Cars was founded in 1927. Today, it is one of the most well-known and respected car brands in the world with sales to customers in more than 100 countries. Volvo Cars is listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, where it is traded under the ticker “VOLCAR B”. “For life. To give people the freedom to move in a personal, sustainable and safe way.” This purpose is reflected in Volvo Cars’ ambition to become a fully electric car maker and in its commitment to an ongoing reduction of its carbon footprint, with the ambition to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. As of December 2024, Volvo Cars employed approximately 42,600 full-time employees. Volvo Cars’ head office, product development, marketing and administration functions are mainly located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo Cars’ production plants are located in Gothenburg, Ghent (Belgium), South Carolina (US), Chengdu, Daqing and Taizhou (China). The company also has R&D and design centres in Gothenburg and Shanghai (China). CleanTechnica's Comment Policy

17. Volvo XC70 returns as brand’s first extended-range PHEV model – new SMA platform, 200 km EV range

Volvo has announced the XC70 as its first extended-range plug-in hybrid model. Designed to meet the demand for longer-range plug-in hybrids in China, the XC70 is built on the company’s Scalable Modular Architecture (SMA) and is said to provide a pure electric range of up to 200 km following China’s generous CLTC standard. The company isn’t providing much in the way of details but a range-extended plug-in hybrid (RE-PHEV) implies an electric motor powered by a battery will drive the front wheels. Meanwhile, the range extender, which is an internal combustion engine, will step in when the battery’s state of charge drops below a certain point. The Mazda MX-30 R-EV is an example of such a system. “With its extended electric range and fast charging capabilities, the XC70 lets you handle most daily travel without tailpipe emissions and at a lower cost, while the efficient combustion engine provides freedom and flexibility for longer trips. This means you could travel longer distance without worrying about charging or refuelling. Combined with its versatility that offers space and comfort for all passengers, the XC70 is a car for every type of journey,” Volvo said in its official release. The XC70 name isn’t new to Volvo and was previously used to rename the Cross Country version of the second-generation V70 (called the V70 XC) for harmony with the original XC90 in the early 2000s. The reborn model you see here looks to continue that legacy and is being billed as a “versatile family car, ready for all kinds of adventures.”
Appearing to be slightly larger and more spacious than the XC60, the new XC70 features design elements seen on recent Volvo models such as the EX90 and facelifted XC90. At the front, you’ll find the brand’s signature Thor’s Hammer LED daytime running lights set above the main headlamps with matrix LED technology. The latter is highlighted by small light bars and is visually connected to the large blacked-out grille with active shutters. In profile, the XC70 look to have sleeker silhouette compared to the larger XC90, with a steeply raked rear window. As for the rear, there are C-shaped taillights that extend into the tailgate as well as up along the window. The ‘AWD’ badge next to the model emblem indicates an all-wheel drive configuration will be offered. “The XC70 marks our strategic entry into the extended-range plug-in hybrid segment, a perfect bridge to full electrification. It enables us to maintain and develop a balanced product portfolio, while offering a highly attractive alternative to customers who are not yet ready for fully electric cars. This is also an example of regionalisation, where we adapt to the local market needs,” said Hakan Samuelsson, the returning president and CEO of Volvo Cars. More details about the new XC70 will be revealed in the coming months, so stay tuned. Looking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro.

The XC70 name isn’t new to Volvo and was previously used to rename the Cross Country version of the second-generation V70 (called the V70 XC) for harmony with the original XC90 in the early 2000s. The reborn model you see here looks to continue that legacy and is being billed as a “versatile family car, ready for all kinds of adventures.”
Appearing to be slightly larger and more spacious than the XC60, the new XC70 features design elements seen on recent Volvo models such as the EX90 and facelifted XC90. At the front, you’ll find the brand’s signature Thor’s Hammer LED daytime running lights set above the main headlamps with matrix LED technology. The latter is highlighted by sm

18. Volvo Group truck sales fall amid tariff uncertainty

Let Supply Chain Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The truck manufacturer lowered its North American market sales forecast as higher duties shake the marketplace. Volvo Group, the first major truck manufacturer to report earnings since President Donald Trump announced his global reciprocal duties earlier this month, reported that overall truck sales fell 10% year over year in Q1 as tariff uncertainty grew. Retail truck sales dropped 13% in North America alone, mostly due to weakness in Volvo’s long-haul segment, according to the company's Q1 earnings report. Because of a lack of clarity about the impact of tariffs, U.S. truck buyers have taken "a wait and see approach" to purchasing new vehicles, per the report. Volvo has now lowered its 2025 North America sales forecast for heavy-duty trucks to 275,000, a drop of 25,000 from its initial projections. In 2024, Volvo's North American sales reached 308,141, the company reported. Before new levies from the Trump administration this month, Volvo had expected U.S. truck buyers to purchase more 2025 models to avoid higher costs and technical uncertainties from the forthcoming Environmental Protection Agency regulation that toughens emission standards for heavy-duty engines starting with 2027 models. However, the Trump administration has started retreating on the greenhouse-gas emissions rules set during the Biden administration for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, according to the EPA.The agency has reopened the greenhouse gas phase 3 standard and started reevaluating the Heavy-Duty Nitrous Oxide (NOx) rule under Trump’s watch. The Biden-era EPA had sought to remove the most harmful pollutants from diesel-powered trucks. "There is no longer an expectation of a prebuy in 2025 due to EPA27," Volvo said in its Q1 earnings report. Global vehicle sales, including for trucks, buses and construction equipment, declined 9% for Volvo in Q1, and "as the quarter went by, there was increased uncertainty surrounding tariffs and their effect on global trade," President and CEO Martin Lundstedt said in the report. "In the fast-changing geopolitical landscape, it is too early to assess the full implications from the imposed tariffs," Lundstedt said. Volvo plans to mitigate tariff impacts by adjusting its supply chain, changing production levels and reviewing sales agreements, pricing and other business terms with customers and partners, Lundstedt said. The company will implement the changes in key geographic markets. The truck manufacturer recently responded to tariff-fueled uncertainty and slowing market conditions with preparations for hundreds of layoffs at its Pennsylvania and Maryland operations. Volvo subsidiary Mack Trucks planned to lay off up to 350 people over the next 90 days at its Lehigh Valley Operations facility in Macungie, Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said in an April 18 email to Trucking Dive. Volvo also expects to lay off between 50 and 100 workers at its Hagerstown, Maryland, facility, a spokesperson said. Nevertheless, U.S.-imposed tariffs and retaliatory duties from other countries have shaken the markets in which Volvo does business as well as the company's global and regional supply chains. "The situation is fast-changing and complex to assess, and no predictions can be made on future developments, potential impacts on the Group or whether trade restrictions may impact the Group more severely than main competitors," the report said. The tariffs could also raise costs for Volvo’s suppliers, potentially hiking the price of Volvo vehicles and making them less competitive, per the report.

This 2013 Volvo C30 T5 is #135 of 250 Polestar Limited Edition examples produced for the US market. The car was first delivered to Autobahn Import of Fort Worth, Texas, and has been registered in the state from new. It was purchased by the seller in December 2019, and 26k of the 97k miles have been added since that time. Finished in Rebel Blue with yellow striping over Offblack upholstery, the car is powered by a turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five paired with a six-speed manual transaxle. Modifications include Koni dampers, EBC Yellow Stuff brake pads, and Whiteline adjustable rear swaybar with adjustable endlinks. Additional equipment includes the C30 Premier Plus Package, the Climate Package, a sunroof, xenon headlights, 17″ Styx alloy wheels, heated power-adjustable front seats, a blind-spot information system, and automatic climate control. This C30 is now offered at no reserve with a window sticker, the owner’s manual, service records, spare parts, and a clean Texas title in the seller’s name. All Polestar Limited Edition examples were finished in Rebel Blue (619) and feature Polestar badging as well as an R-Design body kit. Yellow striping and prancing moose fender decals have been added. Additional equipment includes an R-Design body kit as well as a sunroof, xenon headlights, a rear spoiler, and a glass rear hatch with a window wiper. The Carfax report lists “minor” damage to the front, front-left corner, right side, and roof in a June 2018 entry. An April 2019 accident resulted in “very minor” damage to the rear-left corner. Additional “minor” damage is noted in an April 2024 entry. The rear bumper cover is believed to have been repainted, and photos detailing finish imperfections are included in the gallery. The black-finished 17″ Styx alloy wheels are mounted with 225/45 Continental Extreme Contact Dws06 Plus tires, which were reportedly fitted in June 2023. The car is equipped with Dynamic Stability Traction Control (DSTC). Polestar Limited Edition examples also feature stiffer suspension and a quicker steering rack in comparison to other C30 models. The seller states that work in 2023 included the installation of a Whiteline adjustable rear swaybar with adjustable endlinks as well as EBC Yellow Stuff brake pads. The brake rotors were replaced and the front suspension was serviced in June 2023. A brake fluid flush was conducted in July 2024, and Koni dampers were fitted in August 2024. The heated power-adjustable front seats and contoured rear seats are trimmed in Offblack upholstery. Amenities include a blind-spot information system, a CD stereo, cruise control, and automatic climate control. The dashboard-mounted plaque denotes this car as #135 of 250 Polestar Limited Edition examples produced. The R-Design leather-wrapped steering wheel fronts a 160-mph speedometer and an 8k-rpm tachometer as well as gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 97k miles, approximately 26k of which were added under current ownership. The turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five features Polestar engine-management software and was factory rated at 250 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque. Work in July 2024 included replacing the timing belt, upper radiator hose, thermostat, air filter, and oil filter housing along with variable timing sprockets, camshaft seals, belts, and tensioners. The starter and battery were replaced in September 2024. The six-speed manual transaxle was replaced in October 2024, and additional work at that time included replacing the clutch, flywheel, through-out bearing, and clutch slave cylinder. The driver-side axle was rebuilt in April 2025. A copy of the window sticker lists initial delivery to Autobahn Import of Fort Worth, Texas, along with factory equipment, colors, and a total suggested retail price of $34,345. A set of 17″ OZ Ultraleggera wheels mounted with 245/40 Kuhmo Ecsta V730 tires is included in the sale, along with service records, factory literature, floor mats, and spare parts.

20. Truck maker Volvo cuts North America truck market outlook amid tariff uncertainty

(Reuters) -Truck maker Volvo lowered its North America market outlook on Wednesday, pointing to increased uncertainty around tariffs and their impact on global trade, as it reported a bigger-than-expected fall in first-quarter profit. The Swedish group said it now sees the North American heavy truck market at 275,000 new vehicles this year. Its previous forecast, from January, was for 300,000. Volvo repeated a market outlook for 290,000 new heavy trucks in Europe, adding however that current market conditions meant forecasts were subject to significant uncertainty. U.S. President Donald Trump this month announced sweeping tariffs on goods' imports fuelling concern about the impact on the global economy. Truck makers have been signalling a slowdown in the North American market although some analysts have pointed to signs of orders picking up momentum in Europe. "The divergence in trends between the U.S. and Europe is becoming more evident," Bernstein analyst Harry Martin said in a note, adding that the European truck order intake grew 25% in the quarter, while U.S. orders expanded well below the quarter's deliveries. CEO Martin Lundstedt said uncertainty around trade tariffs and emissions legislation had prompted U.S. customers to adopt a wait and see approach. He said it was too early to assess the full implications from the imposed tariffs and their impact on demand, but that Volvo was working to adapt production capacity and commercial terms to mitigate the effects. Volvo said on Friday it would lay off as many as 800 workers at three U.S. facilities over the next three months due to the market uncertainty. Volvo is better positioned than some of its peers because its trucks business has a complete U.S.-based production chain. Lundstedt underlined this in an analyst call, but said the tariffs could still make an impact. Operating profit was 13.3 billion crowns ($1.39 billion) against a year-earlier 18.2 billion and a mean forecast in an LSEG poll of analysts of 14.8 billion. Shares in Volvo fell 1.7% in early trade, but reversed course and were trading up around 1.6% at 0903 GMT. (Reporting by Agata Rybska, Jesus Calero; Editing by Anna Ringstrom and Kate Mayberry)

21. Here’s how Volvo plans to overcome Trump’s tariffs with new EVs arriving

Content:
Volvo is launching a nearly $2 billion (SEK 18 billion) restructuring plan to drive growth and mitigate the impact of Trump’s tariffs. With the new EX30 and ES90 EVs rolling out, Volvo is taking drastic action to drive growth. After its operating income fell by nearly 60% to SEK 1.9 billion in the first quarter, Volvo launched a cost and cash action plan. The restructuring is worth SEK 18 billion, with most of it being realized in 2026. Volvo’s new strategy includes SEK 3 billion in variable cost actions and SEK 5 billion in indirect spend efficiencies. The additional SEK 10 billion will be added in cash actions to reduce working capital and capital expenditures this year and in 2026. Volvo Cars CEO Håkan Samuelsson said, “The automotive industry is in the middle of a very difficult period with challenges not seen before.”
With “turbulence in the market,” Samuelsson added that the company needs to “further improve our cash flow generation and lower our costs.”
To do so, Volvo is focusing on three areas: profitability, electrification, and regionalisation. Volvo is already leading the premium segment, with electrified vehicles accounting for 43% of sales in Q1. However, with new EVs launching, Volvo said more will need to be done to overcome the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Volvo created a new region called Americas, which includes the US, Canada, and Latin America, to streamline its global operations. In the US, the company is looking to sharpen its product line-up and plans to boost production at its Charleston, South Carolina, plant. Earlier this month, Volvo started production of the EX30 at its Ghent plant, which will help it ramp up deliveries in the second half of 2025. Since it will be imported into the US, Volvo is bracing to take a hit from tariffs. Even the EX90, which is made in Charleston, is heavily impacted, as most components still come from Europe. Volvo also revealed the new ES90 last month, its new electric sedan and second EV built on the Volvo Cars Superset Tech Stack. It’s Volvo’s sixth fully electric vehicle following the EX90, EM90, EX40, EX40, and EX30. In China, Volvo plans to adapt to the changing market with its first extended-range PHEV model, which will launch later this year. Volvo said it remains “firm on becoming a fully electric car company.” Despite a weaker overall market, almost a fifth of the vehicles it sold in the first quarter were electric.

Fredrik Hansson, who has served as deputy CFO since 2023, was promoted to the CFO role effective Thursday, according to the announcement. In a LinkedIn post, Ekdahl did not specify his future plans but noted he was moving on to new challenges. In the post, he reminisced about the company going public in 2021 and achieving record profits in 2023 and 2024. “We’ve had some fantastic times together, and I'm proud to have played a part in achieving some major milestones in recent years,” he wrote. Hansson’s appointment comes at a time of “challenging and fast-moving market conditions,” Håkan Samuelsson, CEO of Volvo Cars, said in a statement.

NEW YORK: Volvo Group plans to lay off as many as 800 workers at three US facilities over the next three months due to market uncertainty and demand concerns in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs, a spokesperson said on Friday (Apr 18). Volvo Group North America said in a statement it has told employees it plans to lay off 550 to 800 people at its Mack Trucks site in Macungie, Pennsylvania, and two Volvo Group facilities in Dublin, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland. The company, part of Sweden's AB Volvo, employs nearly 20,000 people in North America, according to its website. Trump has upended the global trading system that has been in place for over 75 years with a plan for tariffs on products from across the world. His vacillating trade policy has undermined consumer and business confidence and caused economists to raise their forecasts for a US recession. Volvo Group's lay-offs are the latest response from a car and truck industry that is reeling from the Republican president's tariffs on certain parts, which are expected to increase the cost of manufacturing vehicles. "Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs," a spokesperson for Volvo Group North America said in an emailed statement. "We regret having to take this action, but we need to align production with reduced demand for our vehicles." Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review

After pausing US shipments in early April due to uncertainty over Trump’s 25% import tariff, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has restarted exports to its biggest market, with the first shipment having left port last Wednesday, reports The Times. They’re all Land Rover models, since Jaguar is on sabbatical. JLR said in early April: “As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions, including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.” The company is expected to give an update on these plans when it announces its full-year results later this month. According to Reuters, JLR’s US exports account for almost a quarter of the 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models it sells annually. The US is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with a nearly 20% share. Trump’s tariffs have shaken the global automotive industry. The Volvo Group could cut up to 800 jobs, Honda is moving Civic Hybrid hatchback production from Japan to the US, production of Tesla’s Semi truck and Cybercab/Robotaxi could be delayed, Stellantis has paused Canadian and Mexican production, while Mitsubishi, Lotus, Volkswagen, Aston Martin and Audi have all halted US shipments.

26. Lego Technic Novelties 2025: These are the Summer Sets

Lego is launching eight new sets in the Technic range this summer. This means that the Technic 2025 portfolio will grow from eleven to a total of 19 models. In addition to classic playsets, you can also expect special highlights that are specially tailored to adult Lego fans. Three sets are already officially listed on the LEGO Store. Another five can only be found as building instructions on the official LEGO website. The new three include another space model, a licensed Volvo wheel loader, and the Aston Martin Valkyrie. All three will be released on June 1 and are in the mid-price range. The remaining sets - including the largest and probably most expensive models of the year - are expected to be available for you from August 1. With the Volvo L120 Electric wheel loader (set number 42209), Lego 2025 is launching another licensed model from the Volvo brand. Unlike the otherwise rather large-format Volvo Technic sets, this model complements the range in a compact form, consisting of 973 parts. It offers YOU hand-of-God control and crank functions for the shovel, bringing the mechanics typical of Technic into the playroom. Recommended for ages nine and up, the model measures 14 × 35 × 11 cm - compact, but by no means tiny. The price at market launch is around 100 euros. From the Space series comes the Lunar Outpost, a lunar rover spacecraft that further expands the series, not only with Lego Technic, but also under the Lego City label. The set consists of 1,082 parts and results in a model measuring 13 × 31 × 19 cm. YOU will also receive three smaller side builds. A so-called hand-of-God control system enables all four wheels to be steered, and a rotating crane is also built into the rover's platform. The price is a hefty 100 euros, but it is likely to fall once it goes on sale, offering you much better value for money. The Aston Martin Valkyrie is the next mid-range racing car from Lego Technic. With over 700 parts, the set is aimed at children aged nine and over - and of course also at you, fans of licensed racing car models. Included are hand-of-God controls, flip-up doors, an opening hood, and a running V12 cylinder engine. The model measures 7 cm in height, 29 cm in length, and 13 cm in width. Particularly exciting: it is a dual license from Aston Martin and the racing game Asphalt Legends Unite. Part of the price of around 60 euros is probably due to the license costs. In addition to the sets already listed in the LEGO Store, there are five more sets that are currently only known via the building instructions pages. Nevertheless, it is already clear that some of the potential highlights of the year for adult builders are waiting for you. According to the information from the instructions, these upcoming sets include the following models:
These sets were already visible as building instructions on the Lego website in the meantime; you may even have noticed one or two of them. However, the corresponding links now lead nowhere: Lego has removed the content again. It is currently expected that all these models will be released on August 1. One exception is the Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34), which is due to go on sale on June 1. Michael Büttner Editor in Chief

Volvo Cars has begun production of its fully electric EX30 small SUV at the Ghent manufacturing plant in Belgium. The Ghent plant will also begin manufacturing EX30 Cross Country later this year. The gold standard of business intelligence. The addition of EX30 production to the Ghent plant has created approximately 350 new jobs, increasing the total employment to nearly 6,600 people. Volvo Cars chief manufacturing and supply chain officer Francesca Gamboni said: “The EX30 is crucial for us as we continue to strengthen our position in the premium EV market in Europe. “Investing in the European production of the EX30 in Ghent perfectly aligns with our long-held strategy to build our cars where they sell best. Our flexible global footprint contributes to our resilience, allowing us to adjust our manufacturing plans with agility.”
In the recent years, the company has invested around €200m ($227m) in the Ghent facility to facilitate the production of EX30. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The investment led to the addition of a new car platform, installation of nearly 600 new or refurbished robots, an extension of the battery hall, a new door production line, and a battery pack assembly line. According to the company, the production of EX30 in Europe supports the EU’s sustainability and competitiveness agenda. This small SUV was introduced in late 2023, and is claimed by the company to be “one of Europe’s best-selling electric cars in 2024”. The Ghent plant in Belgium and Torslanda facility in Sweden now produce ten different electric and hybrid models in Europe. Volvo Car Ghent plant manager Stefan Fesser added: “Following a decision in autumn 2023 to bring production of the EX30 to Ghent, we were able to industrialise the new model in record time. “Thanks to the engagement and collaboration of the entire Ghent team, we cut the industrialisation time in half. Today, we are extremely proud to welcome the EX30 and demonstrate that new technology and innovation enable us to react more flexibly to market demands.”
The Ghent factory has been operational since 1965 and is claimed to be the only remaining “fully developed” car manufacturing facility in the country. The company’s third car manufacturing plant in Europe is under construction in Slovakia. In addition to the EX30 variant, the Ghent plant produces other electrified models, including the fully electric EX40 and EC40, as well as the XC40 and V60 hybrid models. In 2024, the Ghent factory manufactured over 186,000 cars. This latest announcement comes as Volvo Cars reported a 10% drop in global sales for March 2025 due to lower sales of fully electric vehicles.

29. The Volvo XC70 is back, but this time it’s an SUV

Content:
We last saw the XC70 name on the back of a Volvo in 2016, but now the Swedish firm has given us a teaser of the badge’s return – on an SUV. The new Volvo XC70 is expected to be launched in the coming months, but initially at least it’ll be limited to the Chinese market. A Volvo spokesperson told Auto Express that "there are no current plans to sell the XC70 in the UK market”. However, the firm says it is “exploring potential additional markets at a later stage” and if there is demand, it’ll look into bringing the new model to the UK. While the old XC70 was a jacked-up estate with the ‘XC’ part of its name showing it was part of Volvo’s ‘Cross Country’ family, the new car is a fully fledged SUV. Volvo says the XC70 is slightly larger than the current XC60 and, to our eyes, it looks like a shrunken version of the recently facelifted XC90. Unlike the XC90, which sits on Volvo’s SPA (Scalable Product Architecture) platform, the XC70 is underpinned by the new SMA (Scalable Modular Architecture), which Volvo calls a “premium extended-range plug-in hybrid architecture”. There’s no word yet if this new platform will form the basis of any further models in the future. Volvo says the new XC70’s range-extending powertrain “is designed to meet the demand for longer-range plug-in hybrids in China, where it will be available for order later this year”. Full technical details on the range-extender have yet to be released, but we know it’ll provide an electric-only range of 124 miles - albeit under China’s CLTC testing regime, which is more lenient than the WLTP system generally used in Europe. It’s clear that the XC70’s design has been heavily influenced by the updated XC90 and the all-new EX90. Volvo’s trademark ‘Thor’s Hammer’ matrix LED headlights are a prominent feature, as is a blanked-off upper grille with cooling coming through a lower air intake, which houses active shutters to optimise aerodynamics. At the rear, the XC70 has vertical C-shaped taillights similar to the EX90’s. According to Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson, “the XC70 marks our strategic entry into the extended-range plug-in hybrid segment, a perfect bridge to full electrification, offering a highly attractive alternative to customers who are not yet ready for fully electric cars.”

30. EVs Take 63.3% Share In Sweden – Renault 5 Starts Climbing

Last Updated on: 7th May 2025, 08:44 am
April saw plugin EVs take 63.3% share in Sweden, up from 56.9% YoY. This growth was primarily driven by a rise in BEV volumes, while PHEVs also experienced an increase. Overall auto volume was 24,292 units, up some 11% YoY. The Volkswagen ID.7 was the best-selling BEV in April. April’s auto sales saw combined plugin EVs take 63.3% share in Sweden, with full battery-electrics (BEVs) at 35.2%, and plugin hybrids (PHEVs) at 28.1%. These shares compare YoY against 56.9% combined, with 30.9% BEV, and 26.0% PHEV. In terms of sales volumes, both BEVs and PHEVs saw decent YoY growth, of 26% and 20% respectively. HEVs (up 12%) barely matched the overall market’s 11% growth, diesel-only underperformed the market (up just 9%), and petrol-only was down in volume (by 6%). Note also that sales of “other fuels” (mostly ethanol ICE) have now evaporated since their tax reclassification (as effectively petrol cars), back in January. Perhaps unsurprisingly, for now it seems former ethanol-car buyers have migrated to petrol vehicles instead. The vast majority of plugless HEVs sold over the past 15 months were Toyotas, with around two thirds of all HEV sales. Meanwhile Toyota contributed less than 3% of the PHEVs sold, and far less than 1% of BEVs sold (under a thousand units), over the same period. Stepping back, the EV transition is still happening pretty slowly in Sweden. Year-to-date plugin share is 59.5% (with 33.6% being BEVs). The 2024 YTD figure was 55.2% (30.9% BEV), and the 2023 YTD figure was 56.3% (35.6% BEV). It’s clear that BEVs alone aren’t growing strongly, and thus PHEVs are bolstering the overall plugin result. The November 2022 cancellation of BEV incentives has put a significant brake on progress since. By now, however, BEVs should ideally be standing on their own feet and far outcompeting same-segment ICE cars on TCO, reliability, refinement, and other advantages. They are doing this in some segments, but plugless vehicles remain over 40% of the market year to date. One significant change happening recently (Q4 2024 onwards) is the European arrival of the new generation of competent small-and-relatively-affordable BEVs (Renault 5, Citroen e-C3, Hyundai Inster, Leapmotor T03 in some markets), and with the BYD Dolphin Mini (aka Dolphin Surf), and other models imminent. Relatively affordable here means MSRP starting from under €25k (or ideally under €20k). This segment is already starting to take off in neighbouring Norway, and Sweden will gradually follow suit. The fact that non-laggards like Leapmotor and BYD (and Hyundai to some extent) are playing in this space should make for strong volumes and competition, and thus increased competence and value over time. This will have knock-on effects in improving the value of adjacent segments, and further improve BEV share. The Volkswagen ID.7 was the best selling BEV in April, taking over from last month’s leader, the Volvo XC40, which dropped to second. Another Volvo, the EX30, took third place. The Volkswagen ID.7 has been very popular in Sweden (and in Norway), especially since launching the Avant / Touring / Wagon variant in the summer of 2024. It has consistently been in Sweden’s top 5 since September. While most of the top 20 are familiar faces, there are a couple of notable movers. One is the new Audi A6 e-tron, which saw its highest volumes yet, at 237 units, taking 11th spot (from 17th in March), in just its 4th month of volume sales. Staying with the Volkswagen Group, another climber was the new Skoda Elroq. The Enyaq’s smaller and more affordable sibling registered 180 units, and entered the table in 15th place, in just its third month on sale. Given that the Enyaq has been consistently popular in Sweden, we can expect the new Elroq to climb further still in the months ahead, and likely become a regular member of the top 10. Outside the top 20, the new Renault 5 saw its first month of decent volume (likely including some of the first actual customer deliveries), with 96 units registered, taking 26th place. This is actually ahead of the Renault 5’s volumes in neighbouring Norway (where its competitors, discussed below, have started first). As alluded to in the discussion above, could this be the start of the small-and-competent era for BEVs in Sweden? Let’s keep a close eye on it. Meanwhile, the little Renault’s close competitor, the new Hyundai Inster, is still “in waiting” in Sweden with just 18 units in April, following on from its 37 unit debut in February (it’s already surpassed 70 average monthly units in Norway). It’s a compelling vehicle and will give the Renault 5 some healthy competition. Where’s the Citroen e-C3? Although it saw its first double digit volumes (32 units) in March, and has just seen a strong 173 units in neighbouring Norway, the e-C3 has still not stepped up in Sweden, with just 16 registrations in April. Looking at Stellantis’ overall BEV strategy in Sweden — basically “being ab

31. Polestar North America boss Anders Gustafsson quits, hinting at new auto retail gig

Less than a year after taking the wheel at Polestar North America, Anders Gustafsson is leaving the electric car maker May 11. Rick Bryant, Polestar North America’s operations chief and a Volvo Cars veteran, will take the top job overseeing the U.S. and Canada markets. Sign up for Automotive News’ daily podcast series featuring interviews with industry leaders, insiders and our journalists. Bryant has more than three decades of automotive industry experience, including stints at BMW, Buick and Honda. He has held leadership roles in sales and operations, including nearly a decade as executive vice president of sales operations for Volvo Car USA. In a memo to retailers announcing his resignation that was reviewed by Automotive News, Gustafsson said of Bryant: “From the moment I joined Polestar, it was clear we had the right person already in place.”
Matthew Haiken, CEO of the Polestar Short Hills dealership in New Jersey, said Bryant has “helped run the show” for the past year. “Rick is the day-to-day operator, the sales guy, the dealer guy,” Haiken told Automotive News. Volvo dealer Ernie Norcross said Bryant knows how to balance the interests of retailers and the manufacturer. “Rick always looks for a win-win, rather than a win-lose, because he understands that if dealers lose, the factory doesn’t win,” said Norcross, owner of Volvo Cars Memphis in Tennessee. “His leadership and skills were sorely missed when he left Volvo.”
Bryant’s operational chops will be tested as Polestar navigates geopolitics and slowing electric vehicle sales growth in the U.S. The Trump administration has slapped tariffs of 145 percent on Chinese auto imports and 25 percent on cars from other countries. That poses an existential crisis for the young Polestar brand with only two nameplates — one of which is a sedan made in China — and plans to launch a Korean-made, coupelike crossover in the fourth quarter. Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller warned of a blow from American import duties as the Swedish carmaker looks to shift manufacturing to the U.S. and Europe to reduce reliance on China. Because of geopolitical uncertainty, Polestar paused its 2025 forecast. Polestar gained market momentum in the U.S. last year after debuting its second model, the Polestar 3 midsize crossover. According to Automotive News Research & Data Center estimates, Polestar’s first-quarter deliveries surged 50 percent from a year ago to 1,650, powered by an aggressive offer to conquest Tesla customers. The U.S.-built Polestar 3 accounted for 91 percent of Polestar’s first-quarter deliveries, while Polestar 2 sales plunged 86 percent. Gustafsson, who spent nearly 15 years at Volvo Cars, will waste no time getting back into the game. In a social media post, Gustafsson said he will begin at a “large U.S.-listed company” on May 12 — a day after he and his beloved Goldendoodle, Gussie, “return our badges at Polestar’s U.S. headquarters.”
The affable Swede hinted that his new gig is in the automotive retail business. “Instead of selling cars, I will now be buying and selling around 1 million cars every year — a completely new and exciting challenge,” Gustafsson said. Some of the companies fitting that description include CarMax, Carvana, Hertz and Lithia Motors. Gustafsson served as CEO of Hertz Sweden before joining Volvo in 2009. Meanwhile, Lithia Motors COO Adam Chamberlain will leave the dealership group in July to run Mercedes-Benz USA. Have an opinion about this story? Tell us about it and we may publish it in print.

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) has reported a 1.9% decline in new EU car registrations in Q1 2025 compared with Q1 2024. March 2025 figures show a 0.2% year-on-year decrease. The gold standard of business intelligence. According to the industry body, this decline reflects the challenging global economic environment impacting automakers. ACEA represents 16 major Europe-based vehicle manufacturers, including BMW, Daimler Truck, Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen, and Volvo. Battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for 15.2% of total EU market share in Q1 2025, up from 12% in the same period the previous year. A total of 412,997 new BEVs were registered, marking a 23.9% increase in volume. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Growth was largely driven by three of the EU’s largest markets—Germany (+38.9%), Belgium (+29.9%), and the Netherlands (+7.9%). In contrast, France recorded a 6.6% decline in battery-electric registrations. Hybrid-electric vehicles maintained their position as the most popular powertrain type, capturing 35.5% of the market. Registrations rose by 20.7% year-on-year, with strong growth in France (+47.5%), Spain (+36.6%), Italy (+15.3%), and Germany (+10.5%). This amounted to 964,108 units registered in the first quarter. The combined market share of petrol and diesel cars fell to 38.3%, down from 48.3% in the same period in 2024. Plug-in-hybrid electric car registrations grew by 1.1% in Q1 2025, totalling 207,048 units. Germany and Spain contributed to this growth, resulting in a 7.6% market share for plug-in-hybrids, up from 7.4% in Q1 2024. March 2025 saw a year-on-year increase of 17.1% for BEVs, 23.9% for hybrid-electrics, and 12.4% for plug-in-hybrids. Petrol car registrations declined by 20.6% in Q1 2025, with France experiencing the steepest drop at 34.1%. Germany, Italy, and Spain also saw declines. The petrol market share fell to 28.7%, down from 35.5% the previous year. Diesel car registrations decreased by 27.1%, resulting in a 9.5% market share. March 2025 year-on-year figures showed a decline of 20.7% for petrol and 25.5% for diesel. The gold standard of business intelligence. Give your business an edge with our leading industry insights.

33. Profit warnings and uncertainty as Trump tariffs send a chill through businesses

By Christoph Steitz, Marie Mannes, Kalea Hall, Lisa Baertlein
FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM/DETROIT/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -The fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war reverberated further through the corporate world on Tuesday, as delivery giant UPS said it would cut 20,000 jobs to lower costs, while General Motors pulled its outlook and pushed its investor call to Thursday pending possible changes to trade policy. The Detroit automaker, along with American ketchup maker Kraft Heinz, Swedish appliances maker Electrolux, and airline JetBlue Airways and other blue-chip names, on Tuesday joined the diverse list of companies that have pulled forecasts for 2025 or slashed outlooks, further evidence that Trump's see-sawing trade policy is taking a major toll on companies' ability to plan beyond the immediate term. About 40 companies worldwide have pulled or lowered their forward guidance in the first two weeks of the first-quarter earnings season, a Reuters analysis showed. "Every single prediction has been proved to be wrong," Electrolux CEO Yannick Fierling told Reuters. "I'm surprised if people are claiming they have a view where tariffs are going." The White House has retreated several times on the sweeping tariffs Trump instituted in early April that unleashed a wave of selling across stocks worldwide and prompted investors to reduce holdings in the normally safe-haven U.S. dollar and Treasury debt. The broad-market S&P 500 is down 7% since Trump returned to office. On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to reassure consumers and investors by noting Trump would announce cuts to planned auto parts tariffs to avoid double levies on parts and the materials to make them, following considerable pressure from U.S. automakers. He also touted the administration's plans to cut taxes and reduce regulation to boost confidence. However, executives are increasingly sounding the alarm over how Trump's trade policies have sapped consumer and business sentiment, raising fears that even if tariffs are rolled back substantially, the damage done in the last few months will not be easily reversed. Trump marks 100 days in office on Wednesday, and he may be greeted with a contraction in first quarter U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the country's economic health. As of Tuesday morning, GDP was expected to come in at a weak 0.3%, according to a Reuters poll, but after another round of lackluster economic figures, prominent economists including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan lowered their expectations for the quarter to -0.8%, -1.4%, and -1.75%, respectively. Job openings dropped sharply in March, while the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence in April fell to its lowest level since COVID-era readings as inflation expectations surged. The trade deficit spiked to a new record on another rise in imports as people bought goods to get ahead of tariffs. "The world has not been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years," UPS CEO Carol Tome said on the company's earnings call. While the White House says it is in negotiations with many nations and has rolled back or paused some levies, sky-high tariffs on China and other levies on metals and other materials are still in place, and additional industry-specific tariffs on trucking, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are still being threatened. GM and Volvo Cars abandoned their outlooks on Tuesday, joining most U.S. airlines, computer gadget maker Logitech and drinks giant Diageo. GM delayed its earnings call that had been scheduled for Tuesday morning to Thursday due to the expected change in trade policy. "We're telling folks not to rely on the prior guidance, and we'll update when we have more information around tariffs," GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told reporters after it pulled its forecast for the year. German sportscar maker Porsche AG said it had suffered a hit of at least 100 million euros ($114 million) across April and May as a result of U.S. import tariffs. Shares in Volvo Cars fell 9% after it said it would cut spending by about $1.8 billion and restructure its U.S. operations following a tumble in first-quarter profits. The tariffs are expected to raise U.S. car prices by thousands of dollars, reducing demand and piling pressure on an automobile industry already struggling with a slowing transition to electric vehicles. In a sign of the tensions around trade policy, the White House reacted angrily to a report from Washington-based Punchbowl News that Amazon would detail how much shoppers are paying for items due to tariffs. The retailing giant denied that report, though it said its team that runs its low-cost Amazon Haul store had considered listing import charges for certain products. Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said that "in a normal world" without the uncertainty, the German sportswear company would have hiked its 2025 revenue and profit forecasts after strong quart

34. Volvo XC70 returns as plug-in hybrid SUV with 124-mile EV range

New XC70 sits between XC60 and XC90 but uses a new REx-oriented platform
Volvo is reviving the XC70 name for a new long-range plug-in hybrid SUV for the Chinese market. The company's first "extended-range plug-in hybrid" has been previewed for the first time today ahead of a reveal in the coming months and a launch later this year. Volvo says the new XC70 is designed specifically "to meet the demand for longer-range plug-in hybrids in China" but also says it will explore "potential additional markets at a later stage". Technical details remain sparse, but Volvo has promised a pure-electric range of up to 124 miles, which is more than double what the similarly sized Volvo XC60 PHEV can achieve. The XC70 is described as slightly larger than the XC60 and looks essentially like a downscaled XC90, but rather than being a close technical relation of that car, it is based on a new architecture designed specifically for range-extended electric vehicles (REXs). The Scalable Modular Architecture, or SMA, is said to be "a premium extended-range plug-in hybrid architecture", but no details of its relationship to Volvo's other platforms – or indeed those from the wider Geely group, of which Volvo is a part – have been given. Geely-owned sibling company Lotus is also investing in extended-range hybrids over the coming years in response to lower than anticipated demand for pure-electric luxury cars, and Coventry-based LEVC (also owned by Geely) has been using an REx powertrain in its Volvo-engined TX taxi since 2017. However, while those two firms are using combustion engines as a generator to top up a traction battery, Volvo's new XC70 is a more conventional plug-in hybrid. Nonetheless, the XC70 will help the firm cater to huge demand for extended-range hybrids in China, and its announcement follows the recent unveiling of the new China-oriented Volkswagen ID Era range-extender concept at the Shanghai motor show. That car – similar in size to the XC70 – has been engineered in partnership with MG owner SAIC to target the burgeoning market for RExs in China, with companies like Li Auto, Leapmotor and Avatr among the biggest players. However, like Volvo, Volkswagen's sales and marketing boss told Autocar that a global launch was not off the table: "Range-extenders today are already a very big thing in China. They will be of relevance in North America and we are convinced they will also have relevance in Europe." Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said long-range hybrid technology provides "a perfect bridge to full electrification" amid a slowing of demand for pure-EVs. "It enables us to maintain and develop a balanced product portfolio, while offering a highly attractive alternative to customers who are not yet ready for fully electric cars. This is also an example of regionalisation, where we adapt to the local market needs," he said. The XC70 has an especially important role to play for Volvo as the company embarks on a wide-reaching global cost-cutting drive in response to industry "turbulence" and a "challenging external environment". Even amid that turbulence, Volvo said it "remains firm on its ambition of becoming a fully electric car company", but just a fifth of its sales in the first quarter of 2025 were electric, and it said "premium plug-in hybrids provide a pragmatic bridge for customers not yet ready to switch". The XC70 name has been dormant since 2016, when the off-road version of the third-generation V70 estate was taken off sale. It was originally called the V70 XC, with 'XC' standing for 'Cross Country'.

Note: Note: Includes compliance credits. All CO2 values are estimates according to the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). Only manufacturer pools and individual manufacturers with at least 1% market share YTD are shown. See the section on definitions, data sources, methodology, and assumptions for more. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions among manufacturer pools averaged 103 g CO2/km in March 2025. As a result, manufacturing pools remain 10 g CO2/km from the average target of 93 g CO2/km for 2025. The Hyundai and Tesla-Stellantis-Toyota pools reduced their target gaps significantly compared with the previous month, by 25% and 13%, respectively. The BMW pool is currently in compliance with its 2025 target, while Nissan (29 g CO2/km above) is the farthest from reaching its target. Looking at individual car brands with market shares of 1% or larger, apart from Tesla, Volvo had the greatest over-compliance at 29 g CO2/km below its projected brand-level target for 2025 and was followed by Cupra (19 g CO2/km below target). While Audi’s target gap remains sizable at 30 CO2/km, that is a 3 g CO2/km reduction from the previous month. Ford (26 CO2/km) and Mercedes-Benz (24 CO2/km), also among the highest-emitting brands, reduced their target gaps by 2 CO2/km each. Nissan’s target gap increased by 3 CO2/km in March compared with the previous month, and reached 29 CO2/km. Looking at the major European markets, total passenger car registrations in France and the Netherlands fell 15% in March compared with March 2024, and Italy surpassed France in market size. New registrations increased 24% in Spain and 19% in Czechia compared with the same month in the previous year. Combined BEV and PHEV market shares averaged 24% in Europe in March 2025, up 1 percentage point from February 2025. Norway (95%), Denmark (68%), Sweden (58%), and the Netherlands (53%) all had shares above 50%, and Belgium (41%), Austria (30%), and Germany (27%) also recorded combined BEV and PHEV market shares above the average for Europe. Among the largest markets, the highest increase in BEV registrations occurred in Czechia, Spain, and Italy, where registrations increased 261%, 94%, and 78%, respectively, in March 2025 compared with March 2024; meanwhile, registrations in France and the Netherlands decreased 14% compared with March 2024. Over 42,000 BEVs were registered last month in Germany, Europe’s largest market, and that was up 35% over March 2024. The largest year-over-year increase in PHEV registrations was in Czechia (+90% over March 2024) and HEV registrations increased the most in Spain (+34%). Shares of MHEVs were highest in Italy (32%) and Poland (30%) in March 2025, and they are gaining popularity in France and Spain, where registrations increased 59% (France) and 52% (Spain) in March 2025 compared with March 2024.

Private cars made up over 40% of new registrations in Europe in 2024, and these were followed by company fleets with 36%, and then car dealers and manufacturers and short-term rentals, which made up 14% and 9% of the total registrations, respectively. Short-term rental registrations fluctuated more than other owner types; they ranged from nearly 13% of sales in May 2024 to only 5% in October 2024. In February 2025, the split of new registrations by owner type largely mirrored that of February 2024. Figure 4. New passenger car registrations by owner for 19 select European countries
Over 346,000 new vans were registered in Europe in the first quarter of 2025, a 13% decrease over the same period in 2024. Of newly registered vans, 9% were battery electric; in the first quarter of 2024, 6% of new vans were battery electric. Nissan (13%), the Volkswagen pool (12%), Toyota (11%), and the Renault (10%) and Stellantis (9%) pools all had BEV shares at or above the European average; the Mercedes-Benz (7%) and Ford (4%) pools and Iveco (1%) were below the European average. Looking at the largest markets, shares of battery electric vans increased by 1 to 2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. None of the manufacturers are currently on track to meet their CO2 targets for 2025 and the average target gap is 18 g CO2/km.

Content:
Volvo is facing a downturn as it navigates U.S. auto tariffs and increasing competition in China, all while attempting to reduce costs. Volvo reported on Monday that its sales for April had significantly declined, revealing an 11% drop compared to the previous year. The Swedish automaker sold 58,881 vehicles last month, marking a troubling trend as its shares fell in response to the results. The biggest contributor to Volvo’s sales slump was the performance of fully electric vehicles, which saw a 32% decrease in sales. These vehicles now represent just 20% of Volvo’s total sales volume, a stark contrast to the industry’s growing shift toward electrification. In addition to this, the company reported a 16% decline in sales of all electrified vehicles, which include both fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, making up 45% of the brand’s total sales for the month. Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox. This slump comes as Volvo is grappling with multiple challenges, including the effects of U.S. auto tariffs. The company, which is majority-owned by China’s Geely, is working to navigate these tariffs while balancing efforts to cut costs. At the same time, Volvo faces increasing competition, particularly in China, where local automakers are offering more affordable electric vehicles, putting pressure on Volvo’s market share. While Volvo did not provide detailed regional sales figures, the broader context of this drop involves a global push to adapt to varying market preferences. U.S. consumers have shown a preference for hybrids and traditional combustion-engine models, a preference that further complicates Volvo’s shift to electric vehicles in the region. In April, Volvo also withdrew its earnings forecast for the next two years due to the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing tariff situation. This move, combined with the sales decline, contributed to a 3% drop in its stock value on the day of the announcement, extending its year-to-date slump to 29%. Volvo’s continued efforts to remain competitive in the global automotive market come at a time when the company’s ability to meet sales targets is increasingly uncertain. With competition heating up and market conditions volatile, Volvo’s ability to adapt will be crucial for its future growth. Read More

Volvo AB (VLVLY) maintained market leadership in Europe with a truck market share exceeding 20%, reaching 20.1%. Order intake for full electric vehicles increased by 138%, driven by Renault Trucks and SDLG machines in China. Volvo AB (VLVLY) reported a strong financial position with a net cash position of SEK77.9 billion. Volvo Buses launched the new Volvo 7800 Electric in Mexico, marking the first electric bus model manufactured in the country. Volvo Financial Services reported stable earnings with new business volumes reaching SEK24.9 billion. Net sales declined by 7% year-over-year, with vehicle sales dropping by 8% due to lower volumes. The North American market faced increased uncertainty, leading to a reduction in the forecast from 300,000 to 275,000 units. Volvo Trucks in North America experienced under-absorption in production due to the changeover to a new truck platform. Construction Equipment sales were down 10% due to lower volumes in Europe and North America. The adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by reduced volumes and negative product and brand mix within Construction Equipment. Q: On the investment side, will we see a similar rate of increase in investments for the rest of the year as we saw in Q1? A: Mats Backman, CFO, stated that the investment level will be somewhat higher, driven by the assembly plant in Mexico. The increase seen in Q1 is primarily due to this project, and similar impacts are expected throughout the year. Q: Have strong order levels in Europe continued into the second quarter? A: Martin Lundstedt, CEO, confirmed that the order levels in Europe have largely followed the same positive pattern as seen in Q1, continuing at similar levels into the second quarter. Q: Regarding North American trucks, what measures are being taken given the market sentiment, and when do you expect to be in balance with demand? A: Martin Lundstedt explained that adjustments are being made to align production with demand, particularly in North America. The company is preparing for further adjustments due to market uncertainty and aims to balance demand by reducing production levels for both Volvo and Mack trucks. Q: Can you explain the factors behind the margin pressure in Construction Equipment, and should we expect a better mix going forward? A: Mats Backman attributed the margin pressure to a high proportion of SDLG deliveries, which impacted the mix. However, with strong order intake for Volvo products, improvements in the mix are expected in the future. Q: How should we think about the Mack Pioneer in relation to the 25% market share target in North America, and can it help improve margins? A: Martin Lundstedt highlighted that the Mack Pioneer is a significant platform change aimed at re-entering the long-haul segment. The new platform is expected to improve Mack's market share and margins by leveraging a modular system and addressing supply chain constraints.

Content:
Volvo’s EX30, one of the best-selling electric vehicles in Europe, has encountered significant challenges since its entry into the U.S. market. Despite its popularity in Europe, the EX30’s launch in the U.S. was delayed due to tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles, which hindered early profitability. However, Volvo’s shift to European production has begun to ease some of these tariff issues. On Friday, the first European-built EX30 was assembled in Belgium, helping mitigate some of the challenges imposed by import tariffs. Håkan Samuelsson, who returned as Volvo’s CEO in April 2025, is tasked with stabilizing the company amidst a range of difficulties. Since Volvo’s IPO in 2021, the company has lost two-thirds of its value, and sales have underperformed expectations. Additionally, Volvo is facing mounting pressure from the U.S. market, where it has struggled with both regulatory challenges and competition from local automakers. The company’s stock has become a target for short sellers, intensifying the need for swift action. Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox. One of Samuelsson’s most pressing challenges is the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, particularly in light of Volvo’s majority ownership by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., a Chinese conglomerate. This connection has led to fears that new U.S. regulations could eventually result in a ban on Volvo vehicles. While Samuelsson has reassured shareholders that the company can manage these regulatory risks, the potential for a complete ban remains a significant threat. Samuelsson has already taken action to address these challenges. He replaced Volvo’s chief financial officer, adjusted the company’s return-to-office policy, and is considering increasing production in the U.S. Despite these hurdles, Volvo is actively working to strengthen its U.S. presence. The company is expanding its South Carolina production facility to include more models, and its EX90 SUV, produced locally, remains a key product for the U.S. market. Correction: European production of the EX30 began on April 25, 2025. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that production began in late 2024. Read More

This story was originally published on CFO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter. Automaker Volvo Cars appointed Fredrik Hansson, its head of global controlling and performance steering and deputy finance chief, to the role of CFO effective Thursday, according to a company press release. In the role, Hansson will succeed Johan Ekdahl, a 10-year alum of the company who has served as CFO since 2022, according to the Thursday release. The move comes just about a month after Volvo brought back company alum Håkan Samuelsson as CEO and President, according to a March 30 press release. Samuelsson, who previously served on Volvo’s board of directors and as CEO for a ten-year period from 2012 to 2022, will serve a two-year term as top executive that began April 1, a move which “ensures stability while preparing to appoint a long-term successor,” the company said. “We are currently navigating challenging and fast-moving market conditions, where efficiency and financial performance are key,” Samuelsson said in a statement included in the Thursday release. “Fredrik's deep knowledge of the company, combined with his strategic understanding of the industry's complexities, will be a valuable addition to the company's Executive Management Team.”
Hansson joined the Gothenburg, Sweden-based automaker in 2021, and was appointed to the role of deputy CFO and to the company’s Group Management Team in 2023, according to the Thursday press release. Prior to Volvo, he served as a partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Company, according to his LinkedIn profile. The company’s executive leadership shifts come as Volvo, like other automakers, is weathering ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, such as continuing uncertainty regarding potential tariffs that are set to be levied on the automotive space. In March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles — which took effect at the top of April —  as well as a 25% tariff on imports of auto parts, the latter of which is set to go into effect next month. Volvo recently announced it would be laying off between 550 to 800 employees at various sites across the U.S., in the face of continued market turmoil that is likely to lead to slumping demand for its vehicles, according to a report by CNBC. The automaker reported a 10% drop in global sales for the month of March compared to the prior year period, according to a sales update published on April 2. Sales in the U.S. declined by 8% year-over-year to 14,052 cars, though sales of Volvo’s electrified models rose by 5% compared to the prior year period, the company said. Other automakers have also reported dips in sales amid rapid shifts in tariff and trade policy by the Trump administration. On Tuesday, electric vehicle maker Tesla reported lukewarm results for its most recent quarter, including dropping profit, that followed slumping sales, with CFO Vaibhav Taneja noting expected tariffs on the auto space will have an impact on the company’s profitability. Automotive industry groups, meanwhile, have expressed concern on the imposition of tariffs on automotive parts, set to go into effect on May 3. In an April 21 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, various automotive trade groups warned the 25% tariff on auto parts will “will scramble the global automotive supply chain and set off a domino effect that will lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive and less predictable. Most auto suppliers are not capitalized for an abrupt tariff induced disruption,” the letter, signed by various associations including the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, American Automotive Policy Council and American International Automobile Dealers Association, reads. “Many are already in distress and will face production stoppages, layoffs and bankruptcy.”
The Trump administration is reportedly considering reducing certain tariffs on the auto industry, including potentially exempting auto parts in compliance with the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter. Volvo is set to reports its Q1 2025 earnings on April 29. The company declined to comment beyond the press release. Nerdwallet CFO champions user growth in face of credit, lending headwinds

The recent layoffs highlight ongoing workforce reductions as companies navigate rising costs of parts and materials caused by new tariffs. Volvo Group is planning to lay off up to 800 workers at three U.S. facilities over the next three months, citing declining demand and uncertainty tied to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. The cuts will affect roughly 550 to 800 employees at the company’s Mack Trucks plant in Macungie, Pennsylvania, and two Volvo Group operations in Dublin, Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland, a spokesperson confirmed on Friday.

The report will help the market leaders/new entrants with information on the closest approximations of the revenue numbers for the overall electric bus market and the subsegments. The report includes a comprehensive market share analysis, supply chain analysis, extensive lists and insights into component manufacturers, chapter segmentation based on materials, a thorough supply chain analysis, and a competitive landscape. The report also helps stakeholders understand the market pulse and provides information on key market drivers, restraints, challenges, and opportunities. The market for electric buses has grown steadily on a global scale in recent years. The industry is being driven by factors such government subsidies for promoting zero-emission vehicles, increased pollution standards, and developments in battery pack technologies. Global efforts are taken towards electrifying vehicle fleets, supported by regulatory changes, international agreements, corporate commitments, and substantial investments in infrastructure. Due to the emission norms, there is increasing demand for battery-powered vehicles in public-owned bus fleets and e-bus manufacturers are making huge investments in the electrification market which drives the market growth. Prominent companies include BYD Company Ltd. (China), Yutong Co., Ltd. (China), VDL Groep (Netherlands), AB Volvo (Sweden) and CAF (Solaris Bus & Coach sp. z o.o.) (Spain) are the leading manufacturers of electric buses in the global market.9-14 m segment by bus length is expected to hold the largest market share in 2024.The majority of electric buses in service today have a length of 9 to 14 meters and can accommodate 40 to 70 people. These buses are ideal for use in cities since they balance passenger space with manoeuvrability. Urban transport policies often promote the employment of medium-sized buses in an attempt to reduce pollution and traffic congestion. These buses are perfect for urban transport needs as they have the ability to travel up to 350 kilometers on just one charge. Manufacturers focus mainly on 9- or 12-meter electric buses because they can efficiently carry large numbers of passengers in busy cities without being too large for urban roads.As a result, many Asian players such as BYD (China), Yutong (China), King Long (China), CRRC Corporation (China), and Tata Motors (India) and global manufacturers like CAF (Solaris) (Spain), VDL Groep (Netherlands), AB Volvo (Sweden), etc. offers a broad portfolio of electric buses within 9-14 m. Among them, some OEMs are increasingly focusing on this segment with new model launches leading to grab large supply contracts for different parts of the world. As an instance, BYD (China) sells K8 and K9 electric buses, which have a range of 155 to 190 miles and a height of 9 to 14 meters, respectively. LUMINUS is a fully electric city bus with lengths ranging from 9.7 to 13 meters, was launched by Volvo Buses in May 2023. As electric bus technology evolves, we may see a wider variety of electric buses that are available in different configurations and sizes to meet the demands of various markets.Above 200 miles segment in electric bus market will witness positive growth rate during the forecast period.By range, the above 200-mile segment is estimated to be the fastest-growing market by 2030. There will be a growing demand for electric buses with long-distance commutes. The incorporation of intercity buses is also increasing and with the increasing demand for electric buses in long-distance commutes, companies are focusing on introducing electric buses with a range above 200 miles. As battery electric buses with above 200 miles are viable for urban and intercity transport the demand for these buses will grow. North America is expected to dominate the above 200 miles segment during the forecast period which is due to the charging structure availability in this region.In order to make it easier to use electric buses, multiple cities and transit companies in North America have established large charging stations on popular transit routes. For example, the Toronto Transit Commission has installed ten rapid-charging stations along a primary transportation route. Moreover, many North American OEMs offer products that can travel over 200 miles, increasing the need for buses with a similar range. As an instance, NFI Group Inc. unveiled its latest

The automaker is bracing itself for a tough 2025 with rising tariffs, slower EV adoption, and intensifying competition. Volvo reported a 12% rise in operating income for 2024, reaching $2.04 billion, driven by an 8% increase in sales and record revenue. However, the company is bracing for significant challenges in 2025, as it faces slowing market growth, intensifying electric vehicle (EV) competition, and the ongoing impact of global trade tariffs. While Volvo performed well in 2024, its fourth-quarter results showed a 28% decline in profit, largely due to a $155.6 million impairment tied to its joint venture with Swedish battery developer Northvolt. Additionally, sales in China and the U.S. saw slight declines, underscoring regional challenges. The automaker believes that 2025 will be a challenging and transitional year, anticipating slower market growth and increased industry-wide discounts that would make it difficult to match 2024’s volumes and profitability. Sign up for the CBT News daily newsletter and get the top industry stories delivered straight to your inbox, keeping you informed and ahead of the curve! One of the major obstacles Volvo faces is the global tariff environment. Rising tariffs, particularly on EV imports from China to the EU and U.S., have already forced the automaker to relocate production from China to Belgium. With U.S. tariffs on Canadian and Mexican vehicle imports, Volvo is considering further production and supplier relocations to adapt to the shifting trade landscape. These tariff changes, especially the increase on EV batteries, are expected to remain a significant factor in the automaker’s strategy. The electric vehicle transition is also a key area of focus. Volvo’s decision to delay its exclusive shift to EVs beyond 2030 reflects the challenges surrounding adoption rates and the high costs of EV development. In 2024, the company increased its share of battery EV sales to 23% from 16% in the previous year. Rowan emphasized that the pace of EV adoption would slow in 2025, but Volvo’s hybrid technologies—both mild and plug-in—position it to weather this shift more smoothly than competitors relying solely on fully electric models. In addition to market slowdowns, Volvo must contend with fierce competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, which dominate the entry-level EV sector. Volvo’s premium hybrid models cater to a different segment in China, and price cuts in the premium market are anticipated as Chinese manufacturers intensify their global push. This “hyper-competitiveness,” originating in China, is expected to spread to Europe and North America by 2025. As the automotive industry moves beyond electrification, Volvo is also focusing on advancing software, connectivity, and data technologies. The high cost of developing new automotive technologies is expected to spur industry consolidation, with major players like Honda and Nissan already exploring merger opportunities. Read More

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.] Volvo Trucks is targeting a 25% North American heavy-duty truck market share by 2030, according to executives at the company. Volvo Trucks North America won a 10% share of Class 8 retail sales in 2023 while Mack Trucks captured a 6.8% share, according to Wards Intelligence data. “Our ambition is for Volvo Trucks to have a 15% market share in North America. And it will happen,” company president Roger Alm said Nov. 14, while Mack is targeting a 10% slice of the pie. “The untapped potential is huge in North America, and we have all the possibilities to make this happen now,” Alm told analysts during Volvo Trucks parent company Volvo Group’s Capital Markets Day in Dublin, Va.
      	  			            

VTNA relaunched its flagship semi, the VNL, in January and Mack is planning a similar if not more radical transformation of its key on-highway tractor in 2025, Mack President Stephen Roy revealed at the event.

“I really see this for Mack as an industry disrupter,” said Roy. “We go from a product that’s a fairly old product from a foundational standpoint to a premium product that will absolutely allow us to compete in 70% of the market.”
      	  			            

“We think we can triple our [longhaul] market share with the new product,” Mack’s top executive said, adding that the new flagship tractor, an expansion of Volvo Group’s North American truck production capacity and the end to supply chain woes would see Mack’s Class 8 market share vault the 10% barrier by 2030.

Volvo Group plans to open a truck production plant in Mexico for the first time in 2026 and bought Commercial Vehicle Group’s Kings Mountain, N.C., cab assembly plant, which had been slow in supplying bodies-in-white to Mack. Volvo Group paid around $40 million for the Kings Mountain plant, adding 230 employees as a result. Mack already started to see improvements in total production as a result of the acquisition of the cab plant, Roy said during a presentation at the Capital Markets Day. Roy’s counterpart at VTNA, Peter Voorhoeve, is similarly bullish about the sister brand’s prospects. “The product has never been better. If you combine that with a more stable and stabilized supply chain, if you combine that with the extra capacity that we will get from both New River Valley and in Mexico, then I think that we have the elements to say that we are gearing for growth in North America with Volvo Trucks,” Voorhoeve said. VTNA initiated operations of Plant 2 at the New River Valley manufacturing facility in Dublin in its entirety for the first time June 21. Some $400 million was spent by Volvo on a revamp of New River Valley — which sits next to the Volvo Trucks customer center where the Capital Markets Day was held — ahead of the VNL redesign.

Lundstedt 
      	  			            

That spending and the 25% market share target was part of a long-term plan, according to Volvo Group CEO Martin Lundstedt. “Five, six years ago, we did see that we are getting our act together. We are getting our act together when it comes to serving the customer: customer satisfaction; we are getting our act together when it actually comes to different ranges; we’re getting our act together when it comes to our profitability with captive powertrains and services etc.,” said the parent company’s top executive. “At that time, we said ‘now it is time to take the next step,’ because you cannot grow yourself out of other problems; you need to have the strong foundation that we have,” he said. “Then we took a bold decision, now we do a coordinated end-to-end effort. And that is what we see the result of.”

Volvo Heavy Electric Trucks’ Market Position in 2024
By the end of 2024, 1,970 of Volvo’s electric trucks were registered in Europe. The top markets included Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland. In North America, Volvo Trucks maintained a strong position in the heavy electric truck segment. Roger Alm, President of Volvo Trucks, noted the company’s focus on expanding electric truck adoption. “We have a robust electric truck portfolio for regional, city, and construction transport. Our upcoming electric truck will cover distances of up to 600 kilometers on a single charge.”
Growth in Electric Truck Adoption
Volvo Trucks began serial production of electric trucks in 2019 and now offers eight models. The company has delivered over 4,800 electric trucks globally. The map shows the increase in activity from Volvo electric trucks in Europe from the beginning of 2023 (left) to mid 2024 (right). The red part shows where the most electric Volvo trucks are in operation. “The footprint of our electric trucks is increasing rapidly, with our fleet having traveled more than 140 million kilometers in operations worldwide,” Alm said. Challenges to Broader Adoption
Electric trucks made up 1.3% of the total European truck market in 2024. Increased adoption depends on factors such as public charging infrastructure, cost competitiveness, zero-emission transport policies, and supply chain sustainability. Alm highlighted the need for supportive infrastructure and policies. “Our analysis shows a need for 40,000 fast chargers along European roads to support a potential total of 400,000 electric trucks by 2030. We also need more efficient economic policies to make electric truck operations profitable for all transport companies.”

By Agata Rybska and Jesus Calero
(Reuters) -Truck maker Volvo lowered its North America market outlook on Wednesday, pointing to increased uncertainty around tariffs and their impact on global trade, as it reported a bigger-than-expected fall in first-quarter profit. The Swedish group said it now sees the North American heavy truck market at 275,000 new vehicles this year. Its previous forecast, from January, was for 300,000. Volvo repeated a market outlook for 290,000 new heavy trucks in Europe, adding however that current market conditions meant forecasts were subject to significant uncertainty. U.S. President Donald Trump this month announced sweeping tariffs on goods' imports fuelling concern about the impact on the global economy. Truck makers have been signalling a slowdown in the North American market although some analysts have pointed to signs of orders picking up momentum in Europe. "The divergence in trends between the U.S. and Europe is becoming more evident," Bernstein analyst Harry Martin said in a note, adding that the European truck order intake grew 25% in the quarter, while U.S. orders expanded well below the quarter's deliveries. CEO Martin Lundstedt said uncertainty around trade tariffs and emissions legislation had prompted U.S. customers to adopt a wait and see approach. He said it was too early to assess the full implications from the imposed tariffs and their impact on demand, but that Volvo was working to adapt production capacity and commercial terms to mitigate the effects. Volvo said on Friday it would lay off as many as 800 workers at three U.S. facilities over the next three months due to the market uncertainty. Volvo is better positioned than some of its peers because its trucks business has a complete U.S.-based production chain. Lundstedt underlined this in an analyst call, but said the tariffs could still make an impact. Operating profit was 13.3 billion crowns ($1.39 billion) against a year-earlier 18.2 billion and a mean forecast in an LSEG poll of analysts of 14.8 billion. Shares in Volvo fell 1.7% in early trade, but reversed course and were trading up around 1.6% at 0903 GMT. (Reporting by Agata Rybska, Jesus Calero; Editing by Anna Ringstrom and Kate Mayberry)

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.] A decrease in truck sales in North America and Europe plus increased production costs in the U.S. dragged on Volvo Group AB profits in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company said Jan. 29. The Swedish truck, construction equipment and engine manufacturer posted a profit of $983 million in the most recent quarter, down 10.5% compared with $1.1 billion a year earlier. All Volvo financial data are reported in Swedish kronor, and dollar conversions are correct as of Jan. 29. Volvo’s Q4 sales revenue decreased 6% year over year to $12.57 billion from $13.44 billion, with revenue from truck sales down 4% to $8.67 billion from $8.98 billion in the final three months of 2023. The company sold 58,706 trucks worldwide in Q4, down 11% compared with 65,625 a year earlier. Sales of heavy-duty trucks decreased 6%, medium-duty truck sales fell 17%, and light-duty truck sales, particularly in Europe at the company’s Renault unit, slumped 38%. Volvo Group Q4 2024 Quarterly Report
The Gothenburg, Sweden-based parent company of Volvo Trucks North America and Mack Trucks won orders for 61,200 trucks in Q4, up 24% from 49,347 vehicles in the year-ago period. VTNA sold 6,448 trucks in Q4, down 19% compared with 7,964 trucks in the year-ago period, but Mack Trucks sold 7,104 trucks in the three months ending Dec. 31, up 23% from 5,774 trucks a year earlier. Part of that decline at VTNA was the result of slower-than-expected production. The cost of manufacturing also rose for the same underlying reason, hurting the parent company’s bottom line. Image

Costs were higher than expected because of Hurricane Helene’s impact on supply chains in western North Carolina, the continued ramp-up of the flagship Volvo VNL tractor and reintegration of Mack Trucks’ cab assembly operations, CEO Martin Lundstedt said during an analyst conference call. The impact of Helene was most prominent at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the company’s top executive noted, but production rose as the quarter progressed. “Those volumes have been gradually recovered during the quarter with a fantastic effort, I have to say, by the complete supply chain, both internally and externally, but of course, it comes with extra costs,” he said. Volvo did not break out Helene’s impact on North American costs or operating margin, although it said the company’s overall operating margin on the trucks sold in Q4 fell to 10.6% from 13.7% a year earlier. David Bell, CEO of CloneOps.ai, discusses the impact of AI on the trucking industry. Tune in above or by going to RoadSigns.ttnews.com. Lundstedt said the additional costs were not unexpected with the VNL, which launched in January. The order book for the tractor opened in Q4. “When you are doing these big launches, of course, you need to plan for double production and also resilience in the system,” he said. “We are expecting that to fade out.”
      	  			            

Meantime, North American demand for vocational trucks remained strong, with long lead times because of capacity constraints at body builders, Volvo said. Order intake in North America increased 26% to 16,944 trucks in Q4 from 13,492 on the back of appetite for Mack Trucks’ vocational models and the ramp-up of the VNL. Mack Trucks orders in North America Q4 soared 62% to 7,969 from 4,931 a year earlier. Orders for VTNA trucks in the most recent quarter totaled 8,960, up 5% year on year from 8,548. Across the Atlantic, European orders increased 37% to 29,207 units, with orders for heavy- and medium-duty trucks increasing 68%, largely as a result of replacement demand from Eastern European fleets, the company said.

In Q4, the European truck market continued to decline compared with 2023, with freight volumes and rates both lower. Sales in Europe decreased 19% year over year in Q4 to 29,344 trucks, and light-duty truck sales fell by twice that rate. Volvo expects a much better 2025 in Europe and North America, with prognostications for the latter powered by a rebound in the on-the-road market and new flagship tractors from VTNA and Mack Trucks. In November, executives said Volvo Trucks was targeting a 25% North American heavy-duty truck market share by 2030.

Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) has announced that its global sales for the first quarter of 2025 declined by 8%. For the first quarter of 2025 sales in South America and Asia actually saw an increase in sales but a drop in sales in Europe and North America led to an overall decline for the OEM which cited, “increased geopolitical and market uncertainty” for the drop in these regions. In Q1, 2025, net sales decreased by 8% to SEK 21,117 (US$2.21 billion). When adjusted for currency movements, net sales of machines decreased by 10%. Although machine sales are down for the first quarter, Volvo CE saw a rise in service sales, demonstrating the increasing relevance of service solutions, and an overall increase in orders and deliveries. “As a global company we are understandably affected by these turbulent times, but we have shown resilience in the face of uncertainty and maintained a solid performance today, while moving in the right direction for tomorrow,” said Melker Jernberg, Head of Volvo CE. “Our industry’s transformation may be slower than we would like, but our commitment remains strong as we continue to invest into building a better world for all – as demonstrated by our pioneering 100% zero-emission lineup at the recent Bauma show.”
For the first quarter, the total machine market was flat compared to the previous year with Asia, including China, and South America growing while Europe and North America contracted. Compared to the historically high levels of the first quarter 2024, Europe declined 18%, while North America declined 14% due to repositioning of fleets and market outlook uncertainty. The growth in South America (12%) was mainly driven by Brazil, but also improved business sentiment in Argentina and Chile. The Chinese market improved by 42% on the back of governmental policies to stimulate the real estate and construction segments. In Asia, outside China, the market was up 1% due to growth in Indonesia and South Korea. Receive the information you need when you need it through our world-leading magazines, newsletters

For the first time, Volvo's full-year revenues exceeded US$36.5bn, driven by an all-time sales record of 763,389 cars. Its core operating profit reached US$2.47bn, reflecting a 6% increase compared to 2023 and a rise from 6.4% to 6.8% in core operating margin. However, the company anticipates a more turbulent 2025 due to challenging market conditions and growing competition. While Volvo Cars reported record financial results, it faced headwinds in the fourth quarter, incurring a US$155m write-down related to the NOVO joint venture, which impacted the group's operating income. Additionally, gross margins for Q4 came in at 17.1%, affected by a one-time impact from the sale of on-balance sheet cars. Other pressures on margins included a decline in inventory levels, sales channel mix, and increased pricing competition. Other pressures on margins included a decline in inventory levels, sales channel mix, and increased pricing competition. Despite the challenges, Volvo Cars strengthened its cash flow, ending the year with a positive free cash flow of US$100.5m. "2024 was a year of two halves," said Jim Rowan, CEO of Volvo Cars. "For the first six months, we recorded strong double-digit volume growth. But like the rest of the industry, we experienced a more challenging second half. "Nevertheless, we can look back at 2024 with a sense of achievement in several areas and are positioned well to achieve our long-term ambitions." Volvo Cars continues to lead among legacy premium automakers in the transition to EVs. In 2024, it sold a total of 175,194 fully electric cars, a 54% increase from 2023, representing 23% of total global sales. Sales of fully-electric and plug-in hybrid models comprised 46% of total sales, underlining the brand's commitment to electrification and sustainability. The strong EV performance allowed Volvo Cars to exceed its CO2 targets set by the European Union, securing a surplus of EU carbon credits for 2025. Despite back-to-back record years, Volvo Cars expects 2025 to be a transition year amid competitive pressures, geopolitical challenges and slowing market growth. However, it remains well-positioned with a strong liquidity position and five new or refreshed models planned for release in 2025 to help counterbalance market uncertainties. Volvo Cars' cost-efficiency initiatives will continue, focusing on protecting cash and managing inventories. Technology and product development investments remain a priority, but the company's investment cycle will begin to decline from 2026, unlocking strong, positive free cash flows in the years ahead. "We maintain our guidance on outgrowing the market between 2023-2026 on a CAGR basis, delivering a core EBIT margin of 7-8% and generating strong positive free cash flow in 2026," Jim noted. However, 2025 will be a challenging year, with a highly competitive market and a likely increase in industry-wide discounts as automakers vie for customers. While Volvo Cars acknowledges the challenges ahead, it remains committed to long-term growth, innovation and sustainability. With a balanced product line-up, strong focus on electrification and continued cost discipline, it is preparing to weather the short-term volatility of 2025 and emerge stronger on the other side. As competition in the global automotive industry intensifies, Volvo Cars' ability to adapt, innovate and maintain financial resilience will be key to achieving its long-term ambitions in the evolving automotive landscape.

55. Volvo Electric Car Sales Grew 54% in 2024 Globally

Volvo Cars has released its 2024 sales figures globally, and also by region. A nice thing is the company provides a detailed breakdown of fully electric vehicle sales and plugin hybrid sales, including by region. So, let’s dive into those. I’m also adding some figures of my own — the share of sales that are fully electric and plugin hybrids in each of the covered regions, including a chart on this at the end of the article. Globally, fully electric vehicle sales were up 54% in 2024 versus 2023. Plugin hybrid sales were up 16% year over year. Both growth figures were up considerably more than Volvo Cars’ overall sales growth, +8%. Fully electric vehicles increased from 113,419 in 2023 to 175,194 in 2024. Plugin hybrid sales increased from 152,561 in 2023 to 177,593 in 2024. So, plugin hybrids are still slightly higher sellers than fully electrics for Volvo Cars, but there’s a strong trend toward BEVs. In December 2024, full electrics accounted for 19% of the company’s sales, while plugin hybrids accounted for 27%. So, 46% of the company’s sales last year had a plug! Across 2024, full electrics accounted for 23% of the company’s sales, while plugin hybrids accounted for 23% as well. So, again, 46% of the company’s sales last year had a plug! In the US, the story was very different. Fully electric vehicle sales were down 59%, while plugin hybrid sales were up 69%. These wildly different results are in the context of overall Volvo Cars sales dropping 3% in 2024. Full electrics scored 13,609 sales in 2023 in the US, but dropped to 5,608 sales in 2024. Plugin hybrids, meanwhile, had 22,048 sales in 2023 and grew to 37,294 sales in 2024. Across 2024, full electrics (BEVs) accounted for just 4.5% of the company’s US sales, while plugin hybrids accounted for 29.8% of sales. In the biggest EV market in the world (and Volvo Cars’ true home market now), fully electric vehicle sales rose 33% year over year. However, plugin hybrids were down by 5%. This is all in the context of the company’s sales dropping 8% year over year in China. Full electrics went from 3,281 sales in 2023 to 4,349 sales in 2024, while plugin hybrids went from 12,075 sales to 11,417 sales. Across 2024, full electrics accounted for just 2.8% of Volvo Cars sales in China, while plugin hybrids accounted for 7.3% of sales. In Volvo Cars’ traditional home, and by far its biggest market, its BEV sales grew by a whopping 76% in 2024, while PHEV sales grew by 11%. This is in the context of its overall sales growing 25% in 2024 versus 2023. In volume terms, full electrics went from 75,476 sales to 133,070 sales, and plugin hybrids went from 97,099 sales to 107,355 sales. Across 2024, 36% of Volvo’s European sales were full electrics, and 29% of its sales were plugin hybrids. Together, 65% of Volvo’s European sales had a plug! Related story: Volvo EX30 Wins CleanTechnica Car of the Year in Europe
Beyond the USA, China, and Europe, fully electric vehicle sales grew by 53% in 2024 and plugin hybrids grew by 1%. Overall, the brand’s sales declined by 3%. In volume terms, fully electric vehicle sales went from 21,053 units in 2023 to 32,167 units in 2024. Plugin hybrids had a very similar started point, 21,339 sales, but only rose to 21,527 sales. Across 2024, 29% of Volvo’s sales in these other markets were fully electric and 19% were plugin hybrids. Looking at all of the numbers together, it’s clear Europe is carrying the company forward the most when it comes to plugin vehicles. The EV share of the brand’s sales in Europe are at a very high level, much higher than in other markets. Overall, Volvo Cars is leading the way among legacy auto brands when it comes to electrifying its fleet. Congratulations to Volvo Cars, and thank you. CleanTechnica's Comment Policy

56. Volvo Navigates Tariffs and Market Dynamics with Strategic Shift - News and Statistics

Get instant access to more than 2 million reports, dashboards, and datasets on the IndexBox Platform. Volvo Cars, under the leadership of its newly reinstated CEO Hakan Samuelsson, is navigating complex market conditions influenced by tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. According to Reuters, Samuelsson is focusing on collaboration with Chinese majority owner Geely to cut costs while maintaining a strong presence in the U.S. market. Samuelsson, who returned to the helm after the dismissal of former CEO Jim Rowan, has initiated a comprehensive cost-cutting and restructuring plan. This includes changes in Volvo's U.S. operations to mitigate the impact of tariffs and align with Geely's broader strategic goals. The partnership with Geely is expected to generate savings of approximately 3 billion Swedish crowns ($312 million) through shared material costs and supplier networks. Volvo's strategy also involves leveraging Geely's resources, such as the potential use of the upcoming factory in Slovakia and the Novo battery facility in Sweden. These measures align with Geely's ambition to increase its global sales to over 5 million units by 2027, a significant rise from the 3.272 million units sold in 2024. Despite these efforts, Volvo shares experienced a decline of over 10% following the announcement of the new plan, which includes a withdrawal of its earnings forecast for the next two years. The company aims to enhance its production autonomy in China and the United States, focusing on local manufacturing to avoid tariff impacts and catering to regional market preferences. In China, Volvo plans to introduce an extended range of plug-in hybrids and recently launched the ES90 electric sedan, targeting the competitive Chinese market. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the company is considering manufacturing models tailored specifically for American consumers. Analysts highlight the challenges faced by European carmakers like Volvo in balancing global market demands, especially in a tariff-driven environment. The strategic collaboration with Geely is seen as crucial for Volvo's survival and growth in these turbulent times. Source: IndexBox Market Intelligence Platform

58. Volvo Makes Radical Shifts to Weather the Tariff Storm
Source: Yahoo! Autos
URL: https://autos.yahoo.com/volvo-makes-radical-shifts-weather-192047366.html
Content:
As the situation regarding President Trump's tariff plans evolves, Swedish automaker and wagon savant Volvo is making some adjustments to better equip itself for the United States market. On April 9, the President slapped a 125% tariff on Chinese-made goods, including cars, a move prompted by what he calls the "lack of respect" the country "has shown to the World’s Markets." Trump's latest gesture came the same day he paused reciprocal duties on many U.S. trade partners to 10% for 90 days to allow trade negotiations. However, Trump Administration officials say that 25% levies on vehicles built in all other countries that began on April 3 will still remain. According to a new report from Automotive News, one of the major developments resulting from the ongoing Trump-China trade debacle for Volvo is the exit of the S90 sedan from the United States market. An unnamed source close to Volvo told the trade publication that the automaker is expected to cancel U.S. S90 orders next year. The source said that the brand just doesn't sell enough S90s in the U.S. to justify stomaching the potential triple-digit tariffs to bring them over. According to Volvo's own data, the brand sold 125,243 vehicles in the United States in 2024; a 2.7% drop compared to the year before. However, it sold just 1,364 S90 sedans in the United States in 2024, which are primarily made in Daqing, China. "It’s a low-volume car for the U.S.," the anonymous source told Automotive News. "Rather than deal with [the tariffs], they are just going to cut it out." Related: Volvo Pushes Out CEO in Surprise Move
The S90's exit would withdraw Volvo entirely from the sedan market and further highlight its bestselling crossover SUVs, particularly the XC40, XC60, and XC90. The latest U.S. sales figures show that Volvo sales are up 7.5%, to 33,285 vehicles during the first quarter of 2025. So far, the XC60 leads U.S. sales with 12,706 sold in Q1, the bigger XC90 with 9,369 and the smaller XC40 with 6,469 units moving off dealer lots. Volvo is aware of the tariff situation. In an April 9 memo to dealers, Volvo Car USA and Canada President Michael Cottone noted that the "challenging global economic and geopolitical climate" is impacting Volvo's business. To challenge its tough situation, Cottone said that Volvo is increasing production of the electric EX90 SUV at its Ridgeville, South Carolina assembly plant to help reduce costs and improve volume. Still, it is not the only thing they are doing to combat the tariff threat, as it plans to add additional production at its U.S. factory. "We are also considering the potential of adding production of another car model in our U.S. plant, which has a capacity of 150,000 cars per year," he said. Håkan Samuelsson, the brand's former CEO, who recently came back to the helm following the departure of Jim Rowan, recently told Bloomberg that it “will have to look closely” and make more cars at its U.S. factory to reduce its exposure to Trump's new tariffs. Volvo already builds EX90 and Polestar 3 electric vehicles at its plant near Charleston. However, he said that Volvo will "have to increase the number of cars we build in the US, and surely move another model to that factory." Although it plans to ramp up U.S. production, it will prepare to offset the costs of importing cars to the U.S. with some changes that customers may not like. Though Cottone said that the automaker does not plan any sticker price increases in the near future, it will make "minor incentive changes;" meaning that discounts may be far and few between, especially on models that it will have to import from overseas. People with knowledge of the move note that the plan for Volvo is to use the money it saved from discounting its cars to financially support imported models affected by tariffs that it plans to bring to the States; a plan that it feels is viable due to strong customer demand.

59. Volvo Launches New, Upgraded Machines for Compaction Market

Volvo Construction Equipment unveiled upgraded models for the compaction market, including soil compactors and asphalt rollers with enhanced safety and serviceability features. The new DD15 electric asphalt compactor offers reduced emissions for smaller jobs, charging quickly for a full day's work. Tue April 15, 2025 - National Edition 
Volvo Construction Equipment
Volvo Construction Equipment is enhancing its soil and asphalt compaction product lines with upgrades to multiple models and a forthcoming electric model. The latest machines were on display at World of Asphalt/AGG1 in St. Louis. Updates to the SD75 and SD45 soil compactors and the PT125 pneumatic tire roller include features that enhance safety, serviceability and the user interface for operators, according to Volvo. Show attendees also got the first look at a DD15 electric asphalt compactor. At a press conference, Scott Young, president of Region North America, said that the upgrades demonstrate Volvo's ongoing commitment to offering a diverse product range for those in the aggregates and roadbuilding industries. "We've been designing, refining and manufacturing compactors in Shippensburg for decades," said Young. "So we understand what helps contractors get their jobs done right, as safely and efficiently as possible. These machines are a testament to that." Updates Improve Safety, Serviceability
The SD45, SD75 and PT125 are now equipped for over-the-air software updates as they become available. Their wiring design has been optimized for commonality, cost-effectiveness and ease of service, according to Volvo. To maximize uptime, Volvo doubled the diesel particulate filter (DPF) replacement intervals on these machines from 3,000 to 6,000 hours. LED work lights and beacons replace halogen lights and telematics systems now include GSM/GPS and SATCOM antennas for optimized machine connectivity. Operators will appreciate several human-machine interface (HMI) upgrades, including new software, advanced keypads, a USB charging port and a 5-in. full-color LCD display — the same display available on the Volvo compact double drum compactor and excavator models. Additional HMI improvements include auto idle and auto engine shutdown to reduce fuel consumption and an indicator for remaining hours of fuel. The HMI on the updated SD75 now includes a fan reverse menu selection and an optional five-frequency selection feature that allows the operator to select by surface type rather than frequency number. The upgraded PT125 also has a new drive motor with an integrated speed sensor for optimal performance. Electric Model Will Reduce Emissions on Small Jobs
The 1.5-ton DD15 Electric asphalt compactor is a double drum machine with features similar to the 2.5-ton DD25 Electric. Its size fits small-scale jobs like parking lots, driveways and municipal work. The DD15 Electric can fully charge in three-and-a-half hours with a 240-volt level two charging setup or in 12 hours with a 120-volt Level 1 outlet. Customers will get a full day's work from the compactor on a single charge with typical light usage, especially considering that electric machines don't accumulate idle hours like diesel machines do.

60. Volvo's new ES90 electric sedan is 'one of the most technically advanced cars' on the market

Volvo’s flagship electric sedan is almost here. With its debut just weeks away, Volvo previewed the new ES90, boasting it’s “one of the most technically advanced cars on the market today.” Packed with two high-tech NVIDIA computers, it will also be the most advanced Volvo car yet. The ES90 is Volvo’s first vehicle to feature dual NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin computers, making it the company’s most powerful in terms of computing capacity. NVIDIA’s new in-vehicle computer platform delivers around 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS). To give you a better idea, the most powerful PlayStation (PlayStation 5 Pro) has 16.7 trillion, or around 3% of the computing power. It’s even an eightfold improvement from Volvo’s previous models. Combined with Volvo’s Superset tech stack, the electric sedan is a “truly software-defined car,”  making it more efficient and safe than ever. Anders Bell, Volvo’s chief engineer, claimed, “The Volvo ES90 is one of the most technically advanced cars on the market today. It will also improve with regular OTA updates that are now standard on all Volvo models based on the Superset. The new EV is loaded with an array of sensors, including a lidar, five radars, eight cameras, and twelve ultrasonic sensors, for advanced safety and driver assistance functions. I'm still blown away that these new Volvos aren't 800v. Any non-economy vehicle (and even then) that's on a newer platform should be 800v. Volvo’s safety system, called “Safe Space Technology,” is designed to detect and avoid other vehicles, bystanders, and objects, even in the dark. The ES90 is Volvo’s second EV, following the three-row EX90 SUV, built on the Superset tech stack. Volvo also plans to upgrade the EX90 with dual NVIDIA Drive AGX Orin computers as it improves the lineup. Existing EX90 customers will get an upgrade free of charge. In the preview, you can see that the ES90’s profile resembles that of its hybrid S90 sedan. The teaser hints at a more modern design, with elements pulled from the EX90, including upright tail lights. Volvo will unveil the ES90 on March 5, 2025. You can watch the live-stream event here.

61. Volvo Cars cuts margin and revenue aims after ditching 2030 electric vehicle target
Source: CNBC

Volvo Cars on Thursday scaled back its margin and revenue targets, after announcing it was no longer targeting 100% all-electric vehicle sales by 2030. The Swedish automaker, which is majority-owned by China's Geely Holding, said it is now targeting a 2026 EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin goal of 7-8%, down from "above 8%," due to "increased complexity especially in relation to global trade and tariffs." It added that it was now seeking to "continue outgrowing the premium car market until 2026," rather than sticking to its previously announced revenue target of between 500 billion Swedish kronor ($48.6 billion) and 600 billion kronor. Ever-shifting international trade disputes and tariffs have become a major headache for automakers as they navigate geopolitics between the European Union, China and the U.S., while also seeking a competitive edge in a market dominated by the EV transition. Volvo Cars shares were 3.2% higher in early afternoon deals following a 10% decline so far this week. The firm is holding its Capital Markets Day in Gothenburg, Sweden where it is discussing its product plans for the coming years with a firm focus on shifting to electric and plug-in hybrid models. Volvo Cars has five fully-electric models on the market, along with five in development. However, on Wednesday it revealed that it would no longer target 100% electric vehicle sales by 2030 — which it defines as "cars with a cord" — instead looking for a 90-100% range, allowing mild hybrid models to continue to be sold. Mild hybrids have internal combustion engines which utilize some electric assistance. Volvo cited consumer demand, a slower-than-expected rollout of charging infrastructure, a withdrawal of government incentives in some markets and uncertainty from fresh tariffs on EVs in various markets as reasons for the change. It said it remains committed to fully electric sales in the longer term "when the market conditions are suitable." Numerous automakers have reported challenges related to the electric vehicle transition, particularly from underwhelming demand. Many consumers, meanwhile, continue to complain of insufficient charging infrastructure and cite concerns about range. Volvo Cars also announced Thursday that it was extending its partnership with U.S. chip giant Nvidia as it develops features including advanced driving assistance and autonomous driving. It also said it would switch to a "single technology stack" as it looks to bring down the costs of EV manufacturing. Figures released by Volvo Cars on Thursday showed its global sales rose 3% year-on-year in August, driven by 32% growth in Europe, as China sales tumbled 23%. Fully-electric and plug-in hybrids accounted for 25,028 of 52,944 vehicle sales — or 47% — in August 2024, with the remainder mild hybrids and vehicles with internal combustion engines. In July, the firm reported record quarterly operating profit of 8.2 billion Swedish kronor.

The mobility platform EC2B makes it easier for employers to offer mobility benefits to their employees. This means that the staff will have access to a financial contribution that can be used on the various mobility services in the app - everything from public transport, parking, co -operation to bicycle services. And now it gets supplement from Kinto Shares 2,000 cars, according to a press release. "We are pleased to start collaboration with EC2B that helps us reach new customer groups. That there is a great need to be able to more easily offer mobility benefit is something we notice every day," says Olof Holmgren, Sweden manager for Kinto Share/Flex. The new cooperation takes place at a time when the mobility market is rapid change. After Volvo Cars recently announced that they are closing down their own car pool service, competing players like Kinto have seen a sharp increase in interest from both private individuals and companies.

The Swedish Health Teach company believes that the concept of health includes so much more than you think. It can be about living in a way that stabilizes energy levels, mood and immune systems, or preventing serious diseases such as diabetes and dementia. - We help our users understand their health data. Our service translates blood tests, body measures and other health data into personal insights about their health with the help of AI, explains Peter Vesterberg. The message is clear: With the right knowledge you can get more out of yourself and your life. - We work with prevention, not diagnoses. Saluto is simply a tool that helps people understand their health before they get sick, where we also explain what Hälsodatan means and advise how to improve their situation, he says. But data and insights are only enough to a certain limit. Then someone else may need to take on if you want to see real results, says Peter Vesterberg. - Often, a person who can support in a specific area is needed as a coach. Therefore, the meeting with Elin Breitholtz, founder of the Sakura service, became so important. At this time, Sakura, which offers support for emotional health and well -being through various types of health experts, was still at an early stage. With Saluto, they quickly found a common vision of a happier Sweden, both in the workplace and outside. - As an entrepreneur, I recognized myself in Elin and her driving force to want to solve a problem. She combined personal experience and knowledge by associating with skilled coaches and partners early on who wanted to be part of her platform and travel, says Peter Vesterberg. Through the collaboration, which has been going on for almost a year, Saluto users who need in-depth support can easily be passed on to Sakura. - The platform is very easy to get started with, and there is also a large selection of incredibly talented coaches that stand out on the market. It is not only psychologists and therapists, but they also have personal trainers, dietitians and other health experts. In addition to the individual guidance, with over a hundred different niches, Sakura offers a discreet solution for employers who want to support its employees without introducing private life. Another important advantage of the service, explains Peter Vesterberg:
- Several of us employees and fellow human beings are not as good as you think. Being able to refer to a good portal, without interfering with too much, is very smooth. After all, mental ill health can be sensitive. Soon a year has passed since its inception for Sakura and there is still great potential for the health service to expand in Sweden and contribute to the solution of an invisible problem in society. - It can reduce sick leave, but perhaps above all sickness presence. That many people go to work is physically in place, but are not as productive as they could be. It is an area that many of today's employers are struggling with. Getting help from coaches in time can make a big difference, says Peter Vesterberg. Now he hopes that more people dare to take the step towards a healthier life through Sakura. - Test! It doesn't have to be a big investment, but getting started lowers the mental threshold. Taking the first step and seeking help is really just a sign of strength.

Tesla's revenue from the sale of emission rights to competing car manufacturers has acted hidden airbag as sales dives. But soon it can be a stop for extra income. You know you can create a free account on DN? As logged in, you can take advantage of several smart features. Electric car giant Tesla has had a tough start to the year. During the first quarter, the cargo deliveries fell to 336,000 vehicles, a decrease of 13 percent compared to the previous year. The loss not only means that the revenue from car sales appeared by 20 percent to just under SEK 134 billion during the first quarter of the year. It also means that Elon Musk is at risk of losing another important source of revenue: namely the sale of emission rights to other car manufacturers. Last year, Tesla's revenue from this sale landed at just over SEK 26 billion, almost three percent of the company's total revenue. The figures from Tuesday's quarterly report are more modest and the revenue from emissions sales during the period landed at SEK 5.6 billion, a decrease of 14 percent compared to the previous quarter. However, these revenues help the company keep the nose above the water surface, and without the money stream from emission rights, Tesla had shown red numbers during the quarter. But a lot of speaks to the fact that the loss has just begun. The phenomenon that boosted Tesla's revenue in recent years is called pool. Within EU emission rules for passenger cars and light trucks, there are emission targets that every car manufacturer must fulfill. However, the companies have the opportunity to merge in a "pool" to count their emissions in common. This means that if a manufacturer has vehicles that emit less than the average target, such as Tesla with their electric cars, they can sell this "surplus" of emission reduction to other manufacturers who are difficult to meet the goals themselves. In Europe, Tesla is the leading player in pooling, in addition to smaller players such as Polestar and Volvo Cars. Among the buyers of Elon Musk's emission rights are both Toyota and Ford and the car group Stellantis. Sales of emission rights are also not only in the EU, but also at Tesla's home market USA. However, the recent sales loss means that the company's space to sell emissions decreases significantly. - For Tesla, sales decrease is double bad, as their opportunities reduce emission rights. But the death of one is the other's bread, since the vacuum they left behind is filled by other manufacturers, says Mattias Goldmann, mobility expert and founder of the 2030 Secretariat. An actor who has increased significantly is the Chinese electric car giant BYD, which at the beginning of the year opened to take the step into the European emission-pool market, Reuters reports. Mattias Goldman also points out that the purchase of emission rights from Tesla has become a burden on some European car manufacturers. - I think many manufacturers would like to buy credits from any company other than Tesla. Many end customers today consciously choose the Tesla brand, and then it may not be ideal that the manufacturer they chose instead of Tesla actually continues to fill the company's cash register, he says. A solution for those car manufacturers who do not reach the EU emissions goals and also fails to gain momentum on electric car sales is so -called "pooling", as several players come together and compensate for each other's emissions. Tesla's emission pool for 2025 consists of the car group Stellantis (which includes Peugeot, Citroën, Opel, and Fiat, among others), Toyota, Ford, Mazda and Subaru, all of which buy emission space from Tesla. The Mercedes pool for 2025 consists of Mercedes-Benz, which buys emission space from Polestar, Volvo Cars and Smart. Volkswagen, BMW and Renault are the largest manufacturers that are not currently included in an emission pool for 2025.

The sixth generation Wallenberg steps into the limelight when Fred Wallenberg, 34, is elected to the power company Investor's board. - I'm humbled by the task, he says. You know you can create a free account on DN? As logged in, you can take advantage of several smart features. For almost 170 years, the Wallenberg family has characterized Sweden. Large companies such as Saab, Ericsson, SEB, ABB, Atlas Copco and Electrolux have all connections to the family. Several finance ministers have been drinking coffee with the Wallenberg men and the Wallenberg foundations give several billions annually to Swedish research. Now the sixth generation is taking the step into the public. At the investment company Investor's general meeting, Fred Wallenberg has been elected to the Board. He is the son of Marcus Wallenberg (including chairman of SEB and Saab) in his marriage to Caroline Wallenberg. - I'm humbled by the task. There is a long story with the family in this company, says Fred Wallenberg to journalists at the AGM at the Chinateatern in Stockholm. He has previously worked for three years at Investor's New York office and says he was a little surprised when he was asked to sit on the company's board. Is it free will, duty or anything else that drives you to take the assignment? - I have always thought it is interesting with business (business), from an early age. When I accepted this assignment, it was mainly because it is fun to work with companies and see how they can be better, he says. When it comes to contacts with the rest of Swedish social life, Fred Wallenberg refers that he has lived abroad and that since returning home it has mainly been with the academic world. Fred Wallenberg is an economist and educated at, among others, IMD in Swiss Lausanne and Georgetown University in Washington, USA (where Dad Marcus also studied). Fred Wallenberg works with business development at Piab, which is owned by Investor and deals with automation in industrial companies. He owns shares in Investor worth approximately SEK 16 million. Dad Marcus Wallenberg, vice chairman of Investor, is pleased that the son gets the chance on the board. - It is important for us with the entire next generation. There are many in it and the process must start sometime, he notes. In the past, it was talked about that 70 years was a kind of unofficial pension limit in the Wallenberg sphere. Marcus Wallenberg turns 70 next year. Is the 70-year limit left longer? - I have no idea. We'll see. I do not have all cards in front of it, so much depends on what steps we will take in the future, he says. Fred Wallenberg's job, Jacob Wallenberg Jr., will be elected later in May in the national capital company EQT's board. Jacob Wallenberg JR is the son of the Swedish Enterprise President Jacob Wallenberg (also chairman of Investor) in his marriage to Marie Wallenberg. André Oscar Wallenberg (1816-1886) founded in 1856 Stockholm's individual bank, which became the starting point for what is today called the Wallenberg sphere. About 30 people are part of the sixth generation Wallenberg and have been trained for over ten years in the family's work. Those who receive new assignments in 2025 are:
Stéphanie Ganden - Suggested Board member of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation
Siri Sachs - Suggested Board member of Wallenberg Investments
Tessa Pilkington - Suggested Board member of Nineteen Private Capital
Fred Wallenberg - Suggested Board member of Investor
Jacob Wallenberg Jr. - Suggested Board member of EQT
Elsa Wallenberg Esser - will start working at the Wallenberg foundations. Investor raises the dividend more than expected

72. DN Direkt| 2025-05-07Volvoägaren Geely köper loss ZeekrVolvoägaren Geely köper loss ZeekrVolvoCars ägare, kinesiska Geely, är på väg att lägga ett bud på Zeekr.
Source: dn.se
URL: https://www.dn.se/direkt/2025-05-07/volvoagaren-geely-koper-loss-zeekr/
Content:
Volvo Cars owner, Chinese Geely, is about to place a bid on Zeecr. Geely is already a major owner but now wants to buy out the company from the stock exchange and put the electric car manufacturer in the joint company Geely Automobile Holding, which is controlled by Li Shufu. The deal would give a value of Zeekr of $ 6.4 billion, corresponding to almost SEK 60 billion. The bid means a course premium of 13.6 percent based on the latest course on the US stock exchange. Earlier this week came the news that the Puertorican artist and world star Bad Bunny will be coming to Stockholm in July next year during his world tour. The concert on July 10 in Strawberry Arena would be his only in the Nordic countries. The tickets for the concert were released today. With the high pressure, an extra concert is inserted into the arena on July 11, Live Nation now announces in a press release. In 2025, Sweden GDP is now expected to increase by 1.8 percent, which is a bit below the previous forecast of 2.1 percent. Also for 2026, the growth outlook is written down, from previously 2.8 to 2.3 percent. This is announced by Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson during a press conference on Wednesday, where she emphasizes that the forecast is very uncertain given ongoing trade conflicts. But the risk is that the forecast will need to be revised further according to the finance minister, who opened up for the government to be able to take further measures to support the economy. - Sweden has exceptional public finances. We have the opportunity to do more if needed. So far, it is difficult to say what will be needed, says Elisabeth Svantesson. Two men are convicted of crime after "thoughtless and intentionally" cut an iconic tree in northern England. The jury in Newcastle Crown found the men on Friday, 39 and 32 years old, guilty of criminal damage. The men who have denied crime receive their punishment on July 15. The cutting of the tree, called Sycamore Gap, took place in 2023 and aroused dismay. It had then been standing for almost 300 years at Heden in Hexham in Northumberland, near Roman Hadrian's wall that is listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The tree, an American plane, was known for the wide rides in the success film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" from 1991. It has been described as Britain's foremost celebrity tree and a place where people wanted to get their ashes stretched. A perpetrator has been arrested after the incident in Västerås, according to police. The case is being investigated as murder and attempted murder. A woman is deceased. The VMA that was previously issued has been withdrawn. There is no longer any danger to the public. The perpetrator and the defendant have a relationship with each other since before, according to the police. Four people are sentenced in Svea High Court to prison for involvement in the extortion attempt against former stock exchange CEO Joachim Kuylenstierna. At the end of last year, five people were sentenced by the district court to prison for mapping several managers within the listed company Fastator and their relatives in order to push the company's then CEO Joachim Kuylenstierna on money. They also threw a gasoline bomb at a garage wall at home with one of the managers when the family was at home. The High Court judges a young man with connections to the spring village network for, among other things, attempted extortion. The High Court also judges a man for arson and two other men to assist in the murder. All four receive, according to a press release from Svea Court of Appeal "multi -year prison sentence". In the case, a lawyer and an entrepreneur have been identified as involved. They are released by the High Court with regard to the extortion part but are both sentenced to prison for other crimes. It will be a somewhat unexpected team captain during the home World Cup for Tre Kronor. 28-year-old Rasmus Andersson, everyday in Calgary, becomes the team captain.

The Stockholm Stock Exchange has opened down in troubled trade in front of several heavy central bank announcements this week. The decline is increasing in the morning - including since the German Christian Democratic leader Friedrich Merz went on an unexpected setback in a first vote in Parliament in Berlin. The OMXS index has backed 1.2 percent after the news that Friedrich Merz in a first vote in the German Parliament has not brought a majority of the 630 votes-which can potentially make merz access as Germany's next Chancellor. The DAX index on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange also falls clearly, down by over 1 percent after the vote. The stock market decline in Stockholm is broad. Among the most traded shares in the OMXS30 index, heavyweights such as AB Volvo and Atlas Copco fall by 2.1 and 2.3 percent respectively.

Earlier this week came the news that the Puertorican artist and world star Bad Bunny will be coming to Stockholm in July next year during his world tour. The concert on July 10 in Strawberry Arena would be his only in the Nordic countries. The tickets for the concert were released today. With the high pressure, an extra concert is inserted into the arena on July 11, Live Nation now announces in a press release. In 2025, Sweden GDP is now expected to increase by 1.8 percent, which is a bit below the previous forecast of 2.1 percent. Also for 2026, the growth outlook is written down, from previously 2.8 to 2.3 percent. This is announced by Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson during a press conference on Wednesday, where she emphasizes that the forecast is very uncertain given ongoing trade conflicts. But the risk is that the forecast will need to be revised further according to the finance minister, who opened up for the government to be able to take further measures to support the economy. - Sweden has exceptional public finances. We have the opportunity to do more if needed. So far, it is difficult to say what will be needed, says Elisabeth Svantesson. Two men are convicted of crime after "thoughtless and intentionally" cut an iconic tree in northern England. The jury in Newcastle Crown found the men on Friday, 39 and 32 years old, guilty of criminal damage. The men who have denied crime receive their punishment on July 15. The cutting of the tree, called Sycamore Gap, took place in 2023 and aroused dismay. It had then been standing for almost 300 years at Heden in Hexham in Northumberland, near Roman Hadrian's wall that is listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The tree, an American plane, was known for the wide rides in the success film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" from 1991. It has been described as Britain's foremost celebrity tree and a place where people wanted to get their ashes stretched. A perpetrator has been arrested after the incident in Västerås, according to police. The case is being investigated as murder and attempted murder. A woman is deceased. The VMA that was previously issued has been withdrawn. There is no longer any danger to the public. The perpetrator and the defendant have a relationship with each other since before, according to the police. Four people are sentenced in Svea High Court to prison for involvement in the extortion attempt against former stock exchange CEO Joachim Kuylenstierna. At the end of last year, five people were sentenced by the district court to prison for mapping several managers within the listed company Fastator and their relatives in order to push the company's then CEO Joachim Kuylenstierna on money. They also threw a gasoline bomb at a garage wall at home with one of the managers when the family was at home. The High Court judges a young man with connections to the spring village network for, among other things, attempted extortion. The High Court also judges a man for arson and two other men to assist in the murder. All four receive, according to a press release from Svea Court of Appeal "multi -year prison sentence".

The jury in Newcastle Crown found the men on Friday, 39 and 32 years old, guilty of criminal damage. The men who have denied crime receive their punishment on July 15. The cutting of the tree, called Sycamore Gap, took place in 2023 and aroused dismay. It had then been standing for almost 300 years at Heden in Hexham in Northumberland, near Roman Hadrian's wall that is listed on UNESCO's World Heritage List. The tree, an American plane, was known for the wide rides in the success film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves" from 1991. It has been described as Britain's foremost celebrity tree and a place where people wanted to get their ashes stretched. A perpetrator has been arrested after the incident in Västerås, according to police. The case is being investigated as murder and attempted murder. A woman is deceased. The VMA that was previously issued has been withdrawn. There is no longer any danger to the public. The perpetrator and the defendant have a relationship with each other since before, according to the police. Four people are sentenced in Svea High Court to prison for involvement in the extortion attempt against former stock exchange CEO Joachim Kuylenstierna. At the end of last year, five people were sentenced by the district court to prison for mapping several managers within the listed company Fastator and their relatives in order to push the company's then CEO Joachim Kuylenstierna on money. They also threw a gasoline bomb at a garage wall at home with one of the managers when the family was at home. The High Court judges a young man with connections to the spring village network for, among other things, attempted extortion. The High Court also judges a man for arson and two other men to assist in the murder. All four receive, according to a press release from Svea Court of Appeal "multi -year prison sentence". In the case, a lawyer and an entrepreneur have been identified as involved. They are released by the High Court with regard to the extortion part but are both sentenced to prison for other crimes.

But we have not received any further information yet, but we expect the company to call negotiations when this starts to crystallize, he says. The message of waiting reductions comes in an already very uncertain time for the automotive industry, he notes. - It is turbulent all over the world right now, not least in our industry with regard to tariffs and all other discussions that are ongoing.

Car manufacturer Volvo Cars will save multibillion amounts. The company is now flaging for large staff reductions. - In essence, they are done in Sweden and Gothenburg. Most people work here, says CEO Håkan Samuelsson. You know you can create a free account on DN? As logged in, you can take advantage of several smart features. Volvo Cars launches a gigantic savings program to lift profitability in a crisis time for the automotive industry. In total, 18 billion will be cut to lift the current cash flow. Of these, SEK 8 billion is savings in production. Three of them will be brought home by purchasing cheaper articles in production. Five billion affects, among other things, staff savings in one way or another. - The majority, just over half (of the five billion), are personnel costs, says Samuelsson, who does not yet want to go into details about exactly how many people are. So of the five billion, a large part must be staff cuts, otherwise it will not go, but we also have consultants, Samuelsson continues. A simple calculation means that just over half of five billion can be translated into thousands of employees, but Samuelsson does not want to confirm such a figure. Today, the company has over 42,000 employees. Recently, Volvo Cars announced that Håkan Samuelsson is making a comeback as CEO of the car manufacturer, who collapsed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange since the IPO a couple of years ago. After now being at his post for a month, he is a crash around the market situation that has been affected by President Donald Trump's customs, among others. Samuelsson's return should be seen that focus is needed on profitability and that the owners should get more value for money. But his new plan was given no further reaction to the stock market. The course is raging almost ten percent on the Stockholm Stock Exchange opens. - No, it absolutely is not. It would have been a crisis if we had not acted, says Samuelsson. Vehicle analyst Hampus Engellau at Handelsbanken assumes that the response of the stock market should be interpreted as a danger that it is worse than feared. "Possibly because the cost situation looks worse than they thought," says Hampus Engellau, vehicle analyst at Handelsbanken. Volvo Cars is also investing in increasing regionalization to meet the customs war. This means, among other things, more production in the United States. The challenge for Volvo is to find the balance in it, because it is expensive to spread out production, according to Hampus Engellau. Sure, it risks being more expensive production, but shipping, warehouse and customs costs decrease, according to Samuelsson. - Regionalization is the correct answer in this situation.

Car manufacturer Volvo Cars must save. The company is now flaging for staff reductions. The company reports an operating profit of SEK 1.9 billion for the first quarter. This can be compared with the operating profit of SEK 4.7 billion in the same period last year. At the same time, revenue was SEK 82.9 billion compared with SEK 93.9 billion last year. The company announces that it is launching a "accelerated cost and cash flow plan" which amounts to SEK 18 billion. This will be done, among other things, through personnel reductions. The company just writes that it should happen around the world, without specifying to what extent. Earlier this week came the news that the Puertorican artist and world star Bad Bunny will be coming to Stockholm in July next year during his world tour. The concert on July 10 in Strawberry Arena would be his only in the Nordic countries. The tickets for the concert were released today. With the high pressure, an extra concert is inserted into the arena on July 11, Live Nation now announces in a press release. In 2025, Sweden GDP is now expected to increase by 1.8 percent, which is a bit below the previous forecast of 2.1 percent. Also for 2026, the growth outlook is written down, from previously 2.8 to 2.3 percent. This is announced by Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson during a press conference on Wednesday, where she emphasizes that the forecast is very uncertain given ongoing trade conflicts. But the risk is that the forecast will need to be revised further according to the finance minister, who opened up for the government to be able to take further measures to support the economy. - Sweden has exceptional public finances. We have the opportunity to do more if needed. So far, it is difficult to say what will be needed, says Elisabeth Svantesson.

To pay tribute to the quay, a bunch of proud Ostrobothnia will build a sauna and film when they ship it to the Eurovision finals in Basel. The goal is to arrange sauna evenings in beautiful places along the way. You know you can create a free account on DN? As logged in, you can take advantage of several smart features. One could easily believe that the gang behind the sauna to Basel are crazy quay fans or deducted Eurovision nerds. But Robin Nyman notes that he does not have Axel Åhman's name tattooed anywhere, and that he is even a little unsure why you compete in music at all. Still, he and four friends will soon be in an old Volvo to transport a newly built sauna to northern Switzerland, just for the Eurovision final in Basel on May 17. The journey will start in Jakobstad in a couple of weeks and the preparations can already be followed on the group's social media, under the aforementioned name. The idea for the project was born when the quay exclaimed "now we bax the sauna to Basel" during the victory ride after the middle final. But the most important thing is not whether the sauna actually arrives or not, thinks the initiator Nyman, it is the community and human meetings during the journey. - If happy Ostrobothnian action is to come to life at some point, it is now, says Nyman. Also on the trip comes comedian OA Lönnbäck, artist Tom Tiainen and photographers Aja and Algot Lund. Everyone except the latter passenger is known locally, who are clear cultural nissions with various projects in progress. Behind production also stands a number of other entrepreneurs in the cultural and media industry. One of them is the graphic artist and the advertiser Anders Eklund. He breathes out, satisfied not to have to go on the approximately 2,600 kilometer journey. His task is instead to cut and produce the video material that is posted before and during the trip. His dream would be to make a road movie in the style of Filip and Fredrik's acclaimed documentary "The last trip". But Eklund accepts that it is impossible with the group's scarce time and resources. - But we try to maximize the project as best we can, he says. In the latest video, viewers are asked to tip about interesting people and places that the portable sauna should look up along the roads. In other words, the route is anything but nailed. From Vaasa they take the ferry over to Umeå and go towards Örnsköldsvik, perhaps via Skuleberget, with the aim of Öresund. But the rest will clear later. The goal is to arrange sauna nights in beautiful places, and film when different kinds of guests show up to socialize, discuss, perform with music - and best, of course. When the sauna is built over the weekend, it will be in collaboration with a metal and wooden company, and a sheet metal warehouse that will dress the roof in copper. The symbolic idea behind the roof is that the sauna should shine in gold during the return journey, to celebrate Kaj's victory. - Bert Karlsson said that Kaj will win, so we have to believe him, says Eklund. They are most happy that several private individuals have contacted the travelers, and offered them sleeping places during the trip (otherwise the plan is to solve the accommodation with tents). Someone has also offered half a cubic meter of firewood for the fire, someone else a sauna. The other day Eklund also found a package of sauna stones on his staircase. - The most delightful thing is that it is not only us who do this project, but that it is something we do with others, says Nyman. The local patriotic gang behind the sauna Ti Basel is inexcusively proud of the Ostrobothnian identity and culture. And is inspired by the quay, who according to them distinguished themselves in daring to do their own thing. - They do not ponder how others perceive them, but have just wanted to have fun together throughout the trip. It is fantastic in an anxious world where many just try to copy each other, and find the magic formula both artistically, business and medially to succeed, says Nyman. The quay is not involved when the sauna is to be balled, as they are not allowed to do advertising collaborations while the Eurovision is ongoing, according to the competition rules. The humor group has urged its 240,000 instagram followers to follow the trip, and the hope is that the quay will appear in the series for a bath and barbecue sausage after the victory in the final. There are different labels when it comes to sauna. What rules apply to you? - It will be a cozy journey with respect for everyone. We are responsible for noting nothing to our sponsors. It will be fun and kind evenings, says Eklund. - The whole nake will not be, nor the old stereotypical image of Finns who compete for who can sit at the longest in the sauna, or drink most vodka, says Nyman. A series on social media where viewers can follow Robin Nyman, Oa Lönnbäck, Tom Tiainen, Aja and Algot Lund's journey between Jakobstad and Basel. The journey starts just over a week before the ESC final on May 17.
The series is a kind of tribute and supporter trip to Kaj's participation in EUR

If you run an electric SUV, you can save almost SEK 10,000 per year on combining smart charging with V2G technology. It shows a new analysis from the consultant giant EY. "Vehicle to Grid has the opportunity to create a win-win-win situation," says Martin Cardell, globally responsible for mobility solutions at EY. You know you can create a free account on DN? As logged in, you can take advantage of several smart features. According to figures from car manufacturer Volvo Cars, the average electric car owner uses less than 10 kWh of his battery daily, ie around 10 percent depending on battery capacity. In addition, the cut car stands still 95 percent of the time. This means that there is a lot of capacity there that is unused, which can benefit even when the car does not roll. By 2030, all Swedish electric cars together are estimated to have a capacity of 6 TWh, which corresponds to the electricity consumption for 430,000 households - for one year. And this is where Vehicle to Grid (V2G) comes in. The technology means that you can partly use the car's battery to supply other gadgets in the home with electricity, but also to send energy back to the electricity grid - which gives the car owner the opportunity to sell back electricity and that the connected cars can function stabilizing online. A new report from the consulting giant EY has looked at a number of aspects of technology, including how it can help to stabilize the electricity grid in Europe. But in order for it to fly, consumers must first and foremost want to buy an electric car with the technology. And, according to EY's calculations, there are big money to save here. EY's calculations show that Swedes who transition from a car with an internal combustion engine to electric car can save up to SEK 2,800 per year. If you also use the V2G technology, you can save up to almost SEK 10,000 per year in reduced energy costs. However, in order for one to access the fruits, a lot of investments are required. First you need a car with V2G technology-something like, for example, the latest Polestar 3 and Volvo's ELSUV EX90 have, both quite expensive models. But several cheaper models with the technology will come in the future, including Renault 5, which was recently named this year's car 2025. It has a price tag of SEK 349,900. According to EY's forecast, there will be over 50 million electric cars on Europe's roads in 2030 and in Sweden, sales of electric cars will be expected to increase from 100,000 in 2024 to 400,000 in 2030. Then you must of course get a home charger with bidirectional charging and have an energy system in your property that can be able to return electricity to the system. - Although the cars will have the technology, it does not mean that the benefits of it are utilized. There is so much else that needs to be in place in the form of technology and policies. And some form of incentive is likely to be needed to get a wide spread. Especially when you think about the fact that technology is often more expensive than they become when it becomes massage, says Martin Cardell. The report shows that it is not only consumers who can save big money on the technology. Network operators also have financial reasons to invest in it. EY estimates that solutions that optimize access and load on the electricity grid can save European network operators SEK 44 billion per year. ● Savings per year on exchange for electric car ● Savings per year with V2G technology
